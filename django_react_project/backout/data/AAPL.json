            "title": "This banking giant has been saying cash is king. Now it advises a switch to stocks.",
            "description": "Barclays analysts have been pounding the table over the benefits of cash this year. It's time to switch to stocks, they say.Cash, you are no longer king. Long live stocks. That\u2019s our call of the day from Barclays strategists who have switched their fealty from one of the year\u2019s most popular investment choices to equities. \u201cAfter two straight quarters recommending cash over stocks and bonds, we now expect equities to eke out high single-digit returns in 2024 and outperform core fixed income,\u201d a team led by Ajay Rajadhyaksha, global chairman of research at Barclays, told clients in a note Thursday. U.S. and European stocks, specifically, should enjoy those returns even if bond yields stay elevated, they say.Yields on short-term instruments like 3-month bills BX:TMUBMUSD03M have been north of 5%.Apart from Barclays (as far back as late 2022), hedge-fund billionaire Ray Dalio and DoubleLine Capital\u2019s Jeffrey Gundlach have also been touting the benefits of \u201cT-bill and chill\u201d this year, and millionaires and individual investors have heeded that advice.But Rajadhyaksha and his team say it\u2019s \u201ctime to take some risk\u201d and investors can do better than that 5%. So why not bonds? The Barclays team explained that the argument against that asset class has been clear \u2014 too many pricing in imminent interest rate easing and not understanding U.S. fiscal challenges. Read: Stock and bond investors are convinced the Fed is finished with rate hikes. Why it isn\u2019t a done deal.And: Hedge-fund manager Harris Kupperman says clamor for bonds, Treasury bills makes no senseStocks were a tougher call and against expectations, higher interest rates have not led to lower price/earnings multiples, outside of a brief period in October, they say. An improved economy and hopes for AI-driven revenue and earnings have instead pushed stock gains, as a recent surge has also left the S&P 500 SPX above Barclays\u2019 year-end forecast of 4,200. Rajadhyaksha said they still think double-digit S&P earnings growth forecasts for 2025 are too optimistic, but global economic downside risks have \u201cdiminished greatly. We think stocks will benefit from a fairly benign bottom to this business cycle and look through near-term earnings disappointments,\u201d he said. Overall the landscape is challenging, says Barclays. \u201cIn general, we do not see an asset class that is compellingly priced right now, whether extremely cheap or ridiculously rich,\u201d said the team.When it comes to where investors should put money in U.S. stocks, they admit megacap tech has gotten crowded, but that the market may not broaden out as long as tech high fliers are getting the only upward revisions by Wall Street. They suggest investors pick through discretionary names given the sector is under-owned and say outperformance for service-oriented stocks is likely. They like energy for valuation, capital return focus and the supply-driven upside potential for oil.\u201cWe favor large cap over small cap to hedge against market shocks and for an uncommon opportunity to gain simultaneous exposure to quality,\u201d add Rajadhyaksha and the team, who also like value over growth based on high real rate exposure and low international sales exposure.Read: Options traders are piling into bullish bets on small-cap stocks at a record paceThe Barclays team suggests investors steer clear of China stocks, saying it\u2019s better to \u201cmiss the first 10% of any prospective rally and buy only if there\u2019s evidence that growth is picking up and retail investors on the mainland are buying into the rally.\u201d But they do like the potential for Taiwan stocks given three tailwinds \u2014 signs of bottoming in China, waning geopolitical headwinds and signals of easier U.S.-China relations.

            "title": "The Underperformance Of Dividend-Only-Focused Strategies",
            "description": "Over the past decade, dividend-paying stocks underperformed vs. growth stocks with strong FCF generation and balance sheets. Learn more about dividends here.akinbostanci/iStock via Getty Images akinbostanci/iStock via Getty ImagesBy Brian Nelson, CFAStock prices and returns are a function of the components of enterprise valuation, more commonly known as the discounted cash-flow method. Within this process, there are two primary cash-based sources of intrinsic value: net cash on the balance sheet and future expectations of free cash flow. When a company generates free cash flow through the course of the year, the free cash flow is added to cash on its balance sheet, and the value of the enterprise advances, all else equal. If expectations of future free cash flows increase, the value of the should stock increase, all else equal. If expectations of future free cash flows decrease, the value of the stock should fall, all else equal.Note that the dividend is not a driver of the valuation equation at all. In fact, when a dividend is paid, the amount of cash a company has on its balance sheet is reduced, and the company is actually worth less because the investor now owns the cash, not the company. It's easier to view the dividend as if you were a business owner of a private company. As the full owner of the company, if you pay yourself a dividend in cash from your private company, the cash held in your business is less, and therefore the business is worth less, all else equal. This is why the stock price on an exchange is adjusted downward by the amount of the dividend on the ex-dividend date. That cash the company pays as a dividend is no longer in the business, and therefore no longer contributing as a component to the business' intrinsic value. Investors focused only on the dividend have suffered underperformance the past 10 years. (The respective ETF sponsors. Image generated by Valuentum.)Investors focused only on the dividend have suffered underperformance the past 10 years. (The respective ETF sponsors. Image generated by Valuentum.)During the past 10 years, the main cohorts of dividend-paying stocks, whether the SPDR S&P Dividend ETF (SDY), equity REITs (VNQ), mortgage REITs (REM) or master limited partnerships (AMLP) have vastly underperformed the market cap weighted S&P (SPY) as well as some of the strongest, net-cash-rich, free-cash-flow generating, secular growth powerhouses in the Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF (SCHG). In some respects, empirically, the image shows the higher the yield, the lower the total return. Note that the image above is a total return comparison, which includes dividends and the reinvestment of dividends, meaning that the total return for high dividend-paying ETFs in the image above would have been substantially lower had dividends and dividend reinvestment been excluded from the comparison. It's clear that, despite the excitement surrounding dividends the past decade, many investors that focused only on the size of the yield haven't done all that great from a total return standpoint.This article is not written to cast a cloud over dividend investing. Quite the contrary, it's to help investors make better decisions with their investment capital. I think it's vitally important that investors understand that the dividend itself is capital appreciation that otherwise would have been achieved had the dividend not been paid. This is why it is so important to add back dividends to capital appreciation in the total return calculation. As explained in the free dividends fallacy, if you have a $10 stock, and it pays $1 in dividends, you don't have a $10 stock and a $1 in dividends, you have a $9 stock and a $1 in dividends. Dividends are not additive like bond coupons, but rather the stock price is adjusted downward by the amount of the dividend on the ex-dividend date. We explain this concept in depth in the following article: \"Should Microsoft Pay A Special One-Time Dividend (Again)?\" When a company announces a dividend, its share price is reduced by the amount of the dividend on the ex-dividend date. (TradingView)When a company announces a dividend, its share price is reduced by the amount of the dividend on the ex-dividend date. (TradingView)From what we can tell by the most popular articles on Seeking Alpha, many investors seemed to have chased dividends and high yields the past decade, and I guess for a large number of these investors, they likely achieved total return underperformance. Most of the excitement surrounding the dividend can largely be attributed to the ease at which monthly or quarterly income can be structured. However, because the dividend, itself, is not additive to a company's total return, but rather should be viewed as capital appreciation that otherwise would have been achieved had the dividend not been paid, many dividend-only-focused investors are largely chasing stocks that perhaps they never would consider if the stock didn't pay a dividend. This is nothing short of tragic. For investors, especially retirees, it's so important to focus on total return first, as dividends are paid out of total return and are not additive to it.As a practitioner of enterprise valuation, the discounted cash-flow method, and having learned the ins and outs of the structure of the dividend payment, I've decided that when it comes to my retirement years, my goals will be focused almost exclusively on continuing to generate wealth. I plan to keep some emergency cash and sell off a portion of my portfolio each year in a dynamic withdrawal strategy so that a focus on total return can still be achieved over time. I won't ever fall into the trap of thinking that the dividend is additive to total return, because in reality the dividend payment is just taking away from the capital appreciation component. Again, that's why the dividend return needs to be added back to a firm's capital appreciation in arriving at total return calculations. Had the dividend not been paid, capital appreciation would be higher as more cash would accrue on the company's balance sheet over time. In my retirement years, I don't want to sacrifice the ability to continue to generate wealth by focusing only on the dividend alone. Valuentum's Dividend Growth Newsletter portfolio. (Valuentum)Valuentum's Dividend Growth Newsletter portfolio. (Valuentum)That said, we're okay with many dividend payers, but not for reasons that you might think. In our simulated Dividend Growth Newsletter portfolio, we include stocks such as Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Cisco (CSCO), and Oracle (ORCL), entities that pay dividends but also generate tremendous levels of free cash flow and have strong balance sheets; it's important to note that it is because of these characteristics that we like them. It bears repeating: We like them first because of their cash-based fundamentals and second because they pay a strong and growing dividend, fitting the profile for inclusion into the simulated Dividend Growth Newsletter portfolio. We're just not interested in lofty dividend yielders just for yield's sake because we know the mechanics of the dividend payment and how it fits into the total return calculation.Again, this article is not to say that the dividend is something to avoid. That's not at all what I'm saying. Instead, this article is to encourage you to continue to learn about the cash-based components of valuation, what drives intrinsic value and what doesn't, and how to think about dividends in the context of the total return calculation. I want you to learn the ins and outs of the structure of the dividend payment, too. For one of your large dividend-paying stocks, please have a look at the price around its ex-dividend date. You'll notice it is adjusted downward, much like the share price in the example of Microsoft above when it paid a special dividend. Learning the key components of enterprise valuation and what a dividend is and is not could change your entire perspective on investing. Reading this article may not change your focus on dividends, but it might just change the types of dividend stocks that you like in your portfolio. You can find 3 stocks we like for total return that also pay a dividend in this article.This article was written byAnalyst\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Disclosure: I/we have a beneficial long position in the shares of SPY, SCHG either through stock ownership, options, or other derivatives.

            "title": "The Grinch may steal holiday cheer from these consumer tech companies",
            "description": "The Grinch is expected to steal some holiday cheer for several consumer-focused tech companies, in what is normally their strongest quarter.The Grinch is expected to steal some holiday cheer for several consumer-focused tech companies, in what is normally their strongest quarter.This earnings season, investors were surprised by some grim forecasts of slower growth from a range of tech companies with big consumer businesses: Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.70%, Etsy Inc. ETSY, -3.45%, Airbnb Inc. ABNB, -1.70%, eBay Inc. EBAY, -1.17% and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -0.57%. Each of these companies, with the exception of Airbnb, usually posts their biggest revenue of the year in the December quarter, fueled largely by the holiday shopping season. But this year, consumers have continued to be more more nervous about spending, as inflation and higher interest rates are taking a toll on their wallets. Even with Tuesday\u2019s positive news of flat inflation data for October and hopes that rate hikes are at an end, the interest rates that consumers will face for holiday purchases on credit cards are still high. Read also: The Magnificent Seven add more than $200 billion to their market caps.\u201cFrom a customer-behavior standpoint, we still see customers remaining cautious about price, trading down where they can and seeking out deals, coupled with lower spending on discretionary items,\u201d Amazon Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky told analysts late last month. Amazon\u2019s fourth-quarter revenue forecast came in lighter than Wall Street expected. Other online retailers, such as eBay and Etsy, also see slowing sales, with eBay pointing to emerging softness in some European markets, such as Germany and the U.K., and Etsy calling the macroeconomy \u201cvolatile.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that this is an incredibly challenging environment for spending on consumer discretionary items,\u201d said Etsy CEO Josh Silverman. \u201cIt\u2019s therefore important to acknowledge that the volatile macro climate is going to make it challenging for us to grow this quarter.\u201dIn general, consumer demand or spending issues were the dominant disappointment of the quarter, while many enterprise-focused tech companies were buoyed by spending on artificial intelligence and building out their data centers to handle more processing of AI.\u201cIt was a better-than-expected earnings season, not if you consider top-line beats, lots of the tech names surpassed on the top and bottom line,\u201d said Christine Short, vice president of strategy at Wall Street Horizons. \u201cIt was the commentary that threw me off.\u201dApple surprised Wall Street with its lackluster forecast for the December quarter, guiding for a fiscal first quarter \u201csimilar\u201d to its October quarter, in which revenue fell less than 1%. And that was for a quarter that included some new iPhone 15 sales. Its revenue could even potentially fall in the December quarter. Bernstein Research analyst Toni Sacconaghi said in a recent note that he is expecting a \u201cmuted iPhone cycle\u201d this year, and is forecasting iPhone sales will be down 3.5% for the fiscal 2024 full year. This year\u2019s holiday spending is expected to come close to last year\u2019s results, according to a forecast issued by Circana, formerly the NPD Group, late last month. But the research firm added that overall spending may fall short by as much as 2.5% in the November-December timeframe. Additionally, a survey of 1,000 U.S. consumers by McKinsey & Co. showed 79% are changing behaviors, buying lower-cost items or foregoing purchases entirely. \u201cGeneral consumer sentiment about the U.S. economy is one of uncertainty,\u201d the market-research firm said.Some credit-card companies are giving mixed signals. Last month, Mastercard MA, -0.17%, while highlighting \u201ccontinued resilience in consumer spending\u201d in the third quarter, also reported a sequential growth slowdown in October, rattling investors. The ongoing Israel-Hamas war is also fueling uncertainties. For advertisers on consumer internet platforms, such as Meta\u2019s META, +0.08% Facebook, Instagram and Snap Inc. SNAP, -1.15%, the conflict is causing \u201cgreater uncertainties\u201d and \u201cvolatility.\u201d Meta warned of softer ad spending in the fourth quarter. As the large retailers report third-quarter results this week, investors will continue to focus on their forecasts, especially after Home Depot Inc. HD, -0.91% had a mixed call on Tuesday. Executives said that while the \u201cworst of the inflationary environment may be behind us,\u201d they still pointed to consumers staying away from certain \u201cbig-ticket items,\u201d and working on smaller home projects, rather than taking on bigger costly ones.Electric-vehicle maker Tesla Inc. TSLA, -4.25% Chief Executive Elon Musk was uncharacteristically gloomy on the company\u2019s most recent earnings call, talking about how he was worried about how the high-interest-rate environment would affect the car-buying public.Are all the cautious CEOs just sandbagging, and hoping to blow out their fourth quarters? Or at least exceed their \u201cmeh\u201d expectations? \u201cThey are all trying to mange expectations, under-promise and over-deliver,\u201d said Short of Wall Street Horizons. \u201cYou are seeing analysts draw down expectations for the fourth quarter.\u201d She pointed out that in October, estimates came down 4%, versus the typical 1% to 2%. \u201cThis quarter, Q3, we have had the highest number of CEOs who were more uncertain than they have been since they were in the middle of the pandemic.\u201dSo while next year should look brighter \u2014 especially if the Fed begins to lower rates, as some are now predicting \u2014 this holiday season could be a bleak one for many consumer-focused tech companies. Cisco slashed its revenue forecast for the fiscal year, and its shares were plunging in Wednesday's extended session.Therese Poletti writes the \"Tech Tales\" column for MarketWatch.

The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of seven year duration or less.

            "description": "Harris Kupperman, founder of hedge fund Praetorian Capital, says uranium, Florida and oil service companies are the best bets going right now.Stocks higher after Tuesday\u2019s blockbuster session that pretty much declared the Fed\u2019s rate-hike campaign over, sending bond prices soaring. Not everyone is at ease though, with both Citadel founder Ken Griffin and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon cautioning that investors may be getting ahead of themselves. Indeed, they face a major blind spot, says the founder of hedge fund Praetorian Capital, Harris \u201cKuppy\u201d Kupperman: \u201cThe [U.S.] government is about to go bankrupt. They should be looking at what happened in Zimbabwe and plan appropriately.\u201dSpeaking to MarketWatch the Monday before CPI data, he said the clamor for bonds or Treasury bills right now makes no sense to him. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t lend these guys money for a beer overnight,\u201d he says.But then the mandate for his $260 million flagship Praetorian Capital Fund is to find investments \u201cundergoing some sort of dynamic change\u201d flying under the radar. Up 748% since its 2019 inception, the fund had triple digit returns in 2020 and 2021, and has gained 18% so far this year \u2014 but he says the last six quarters have been hard for many of his investment themes.\u201cThings are going much better than I had expected in the businesses themselves, unfortunately the share prices just haven\u2019t kept up with the\u2026fundamental realities of the business,\u201d Kupperman said. \u201cI think there\u2019s a catch-up phase that\u2019s overdue.\u201dThe manager rightly called a tech selloff in 2022 \u2014 he isn\u2019t interested in the Magnificent Seven tech names as he says they\u2019re too expensive \u2014 but his prediction for oil prices to reach $200 this year has not panned out. Read: The Magnificent Seven add more than $200 billion to their market capsEnergy, though, is part of one theme he\u2019s not about to abandon. The hedge fund\u2019s two biggest positions are oil-field services companies Valaris VAL, -4.19% and Tidewater TDW, -2.81%, up around 4% and 64%, respectively. Read: This hot sector is producing returns like Nvidia\u2019s \u2014 and it\u2019s got nothing to do with AIHe notes some \u201cspectacular\u201d earnings recently from Valaris, which the fund started buying in the low $20s \u2014 it currently trades at $70 per share.Valaris is currently earning just over $200,000 a day on drilling charter rates \u2014 the daily cost to rent out their equipment \u2014 but rival Diamond Offshore DO, -4.63% just signed a charter contract worth over $500,000 a day, he notes. Valaris has also been signing new contracts in the $400,000s for several months, which means substantial cash flow going forward, he said.\u201cGiven its order book, charter rates and how much cash flow it can produce, Valaris should be trading at $100 [per share].\u201dHe says the fundamentals are also there for prices of uranium \u2014 a theme he\u2019s well known for \u2014 to shoot higher. \u201cIt reminds me of back in 2003 when I played it and it went from $12 to $130,\u201d he says of the commodity currently.Read: Why uranium prices have climbed to their highest in over a decadeKupperman sees demand driven by many factors \u2014 Japan reactors getting turned back on, and more being built across China, India and Indonesia \u2014 and limited supply. \u201cAnd so the price of uranium this year has increased from roughly $50 to $75 \u2026 50%, which is good, but it\u2019s still below the cost needed to build a new mine.\u201d\u201cAlmost every week, we learn about a new positive development in the nuclear sector,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the world\u2019s coming around to nuclear as the least bad energy option out there,\u201d said the manager.But the price will probably have to go \u201cdramatically higher,\u201d to encourage more mine building, and sees 2025 as the peak year for uranium deficits. They see 2024 demand at 210 million pounds globally versus supply forecasts of 160 million pounds globally. Kupperman invests in Sprott Physical Uranium Trust SRUUF and U.K.-based uranium investment group Yellow Cake YCA, +0.18%, but avoids junior miners that he thinks are \u201cspeculative and risky.He\u2019s also sticking to a bet on St. Joe JOE, -0.89%, one of Florida\u2019s biggest landowners with some of the state\u2019s best land. \u201cFlorida has the most net migration of a state right now, people are really desperately leaving all the terrible places in the northeast that are crime ridden, [with] bad weather and high taxes and they want to go somewhere nice,\u201d he says. The 87-year old company\u2019s shares are up 34% so far this year. St. Joe is \u201cincreasing the value of the 170,000 acres of land it owns as more people move to Florida, and are also developing commercial real estate and \u201cdoing surprisingly well.\u201d\u201cI think this stock trades at about 20% of replacement cost and we\u2019re value investors and we buy things very cheaply and it has massive tailwinds,\u201d said Kupperman. His fund targets up to 12 themes, but has about five themes at any given time that take up 50% to 75% of the portfolio. Right now he\u2019s buying shares of a new company that\u2019s still under wraps. In his October letter to investors, he described it as a company that has \u201chistorically produced elevated returns on capital\u201d though has seen share prices fall due to a likely weak third quarter.

Learn MoreAmazon (AMZN -0.62%) and Apple (AAPL 0.80%) are two of the most closely followed stocks, and among the world's five most valuable companies by market cap. These tech giants rule their respective industries, with one dominating e-commerce and the other leading consumer tech. As a result, their stocks still have much to offer new investors over the long term and could be some of the smartest buys right now.Macroeconomic headwinds over the last two years have challenged countless companies. Reductions in consumer discretionary spending led to steep declines in Amazon's retail profits in 2022. Meanwhile, Apple has experienced repeated dips in product revenue. However, economic hurdles won't last forever, and these companies are well positioned to profit substantially from a market recovery.So, let's examine whether Amazon or Apple is the better buy this month.In fiscal 2022, Amazon posted operating losses of $10.6 billion between its two e-commerce segments. The company remained profitable thanks to its lucrative cloud business, Amazon Web Services (AWS). However, the e-commerce declines led management to rethink its business model and introduce various cost-cutting measures, closing dozens of warehouses, sunsetting unprofitable projects, and laying off thousands of people.The restructuring paid off as Amazon's retail business returned to profitability this year. Its North American segment hit over $4 billion in operating income in the third quarter, compared to the $412 million in losses it reported the year before. In addition to e-commerce growth, Amazon is steadily expanding in artificial intelligence (AI), a market that has blown up in 2023. The company has added several new AI tools to AWS as it works to meet soaring demand for such services. AWS has solid prospects in this high-growth space with its leading market share and a long list of prominent clients that includes Netflix, Sony, and Meta.Amazon shares have soared 70% year to date as Wall Street has recognized the improvements in its retail business and its growing prospects in AI. The company is on a promising growth trajectory that could be worth an investment.Apple hasn't had it as easy as Amazon this year. Its revenues have tumbled 3% year over year in fiscal 2023 as each of its four product segments reported declining sales. The company has continued to experience pullbacks from consumers due to inflation and higher interest rates. Yet despite those recent challenges, Apple shares have risen 42% year to date. Data by YCharts.Apple has a long history of providing investors with consistent gains. The chart above shows its shares have outperformed some of its biggest competitors over the last five years, among them Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon. While past growth isn't always indicative of what is to come, Apple is making moves to keep its business expanding over the long term.The company is home to a highly profitable services business, which includes the App Store and subscription platforms like Apple TV+, Apple Music, and more. The digital business boasts profit margins of 70%, significantly higher than its margin for products, which hovers around 36%. Indeed, services may be on track to eventually surpass the iPhone as Apple's highest-earning segment, as revenue growth has hit 9% in 2023 compared to the iPhone's decline of 2%. Apple is gradually shifting its business to more digital markets that are less vulnerable to economic fluctuations. It's also expanding into AI and has reportedly developed its own version of OpenAI's ChatGPT. The company has excellent prospects over the long term, and its stock looks like an attractive buy for patient investors.Amazon and Apple are two compelling investments with excellent prospects over the next decade. However, Amazon's meteoric stock rise this year has made it significantly more expensive than Apple. The chart below compares the companies' price-to-earnings and price-to-free-cash-flow ratios. Apple comes out on top for both metrics. The figures indicate that Apple's stock offers far more value right now.Data by YCharts.Moreover, despite recent declines, the iPhone company brought in more than $99 billion in free cash flow in its latest quarter compared to Amazon's free cash flow of $17 billion. Apple's business is on better footing financially, making it a more reliable investment.Furthermore, Apple shares have dipped 5% since the end of July, which has only made its stock more attractive. Now would be an excellent time to make a long-term investment in the MacBook company. However, it would still be smart to keep Amazon on your radar in case its stock dips to a more attractive valuation.John Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool\u2019s board of directors.

Learn MoreRetirement is an easy thing to lose sight of in the day-to-day hustle and bustle. But planning for retirement is one of the most important things we will do in our lives. Maybe it seems a long way off. But let me tell you, time moves quickly as we age, and putting off saving and investing makes it more challenging to have the lifestyle we desire in our golden years.The good news is that there are several options to reach your goals, like:Let's take a look.There's a great lesson in the tortoise and the hare story, but it may not be the best when it comes to saving for retirement. It's a myth that most people can \"just save\" enough money to retire comfortably. Yes, you can grow $100,000 into $1 million this way, but it takes way too long and requires massive income.If you managed to squirrel away $1,000 per month and did not invest, it would take 76 years to go from $100,000 to $1 million. You could up your savings to $2,000 per month and make it in 38 years, but neither scenario is realistic for most people. The verdict on scenario No. 1? No, thank you.Interest rates are rising, and earning a risk-free 5% on a certificate of deposit (CD) or U.S. Treasury is tempting. There is no need to check the market, no risk of losing your principal, and no study or expertise required. But this process is also too slow for most people. It would take nearly 50 years to turn $100,000 into $1 million by earning 5% compounded annually. So, option No. 2 is out.But what happens if you combine the two options? You could make it to $1 million by saving just $500 monthly and earning 5% interest in 33 years. Assuming a retirement age of 65, you'd need to start this process by 32 years old. That's certainly not out of the question, but still not the best option.The S&P 500 has averaged 10% returns, including dividends, over the past 30 years. At this rate, you cut your time to $1 million down to 25 years. This is much more realistic and doesn't require additional savings. However, if you also save and invest $500 per month, the time can be reduced to under 20 years.Several terrific dividend growth stocks have performed wonderfully over the past 20 years and beat the overall market, as shown below.Total Return Level data by YChartsThe chart above shows the growth of $100,000 over the past 20 years, including dividends. Starbucks and Home Depot easily exceeded the million-dollar mark, while Lowe's and Texas Instruments made strong showings. All of them beat the overall market.Perhaps the best thing about dividend growth investing is that you don't need any particular expertise to understand and invest in them. Most consumers are familiar with the two mammoth home improvement stores and the Seattle coffee seller. Texas Instruments sells analog semiconductors, and even if you aren't familiar with them, you probably use them daily, and they aren't particularly high-tech. For more on Texas Instruments, check out this article on the power of dividend growth investing.What do Tesla, Nvidia, and ServiceNow have in common? They have grown $100,000 into more than $1 million over the past 10 years, as shown below.TSLA data by YChartsNvidia is the big winner, and kudos to anyone who got in early. This is the most exciting (and quickest!) way to reach $1 million, but also the most risky and difficult. For every Tesla and Nvidia, there are heaps of companies that never take off. They are also challenging to find in their infancy. Few predicted that Nvidia's technology would beat the competition and be critical to today's data center needs back in 2013.What is the fledgling investment now that will be critical to the economy in 2033? Artificial intelligence (AI) seems like the most obvious area, but even this isn't guaranteed. Remember, 3D printing was forecast to change the world several years ago, but that trend fizzled quickly. Still, many believe that AI will be as transformative to the economy as the internet in time.Ask any retiree, and I'll bet one of their biggest regrets will be not starting investing early enough or getting educated about money management. There are several ways to reach your retirement goals, but the best way is to invest in knowledge first. Your ultimate plan will depend on your age, risk tolerance, and lifestyle. Often, a combination of saving, interest, dividend growth stocks, and a sprinkle of moonshots is the best recipe.Bradley Guichard has positions in Lowe's Companies, Nvidia, and Texas Instruments and has the following options: long September 2024 $630 calls on Nvidia.

However, underneath this strong performance is a tale of two segments:Data by YChartsEven dividend ETF investors (SCHD)(VYM) have suffered this year:Data by YChartsIn this article, we will look at why this bifurcation has taken place and share why we believe that it is about to shift in a major way moving forward.Dividend stocks, particularly Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), utilities, yield cos, and infrastructure businesses, have underperformed the S&P 500 this year primarily because of two major catalysts:Higher for long interest rates tend to hurt defensive dividend stocks for the following three main reasons:When interest rates rise, defensive and contracted cash-flowing investments like REITs, utilities, yield cos, and existing fixed-rate long-dated bonds become less attractive, as investors can invest in newly issued bonds at higher relative yields, making existing income investments less appealing in comparison.Many companies in sectors like utilities, real estate, and infrastructure rely on debt financing for their capital-intensive projects. When interest rates increase, their borrowing costs rise, which can negatively impact their profitability and, consequently, their stock prices as investors become wary of these companies' ability to generate returns in a higher interest rate environment.In a rising interest rate environment, investors tend to become more risk-averse. While dividend stocks in sectors like REITs and utilities are generally viewed as defensive investments, the perception of their risk can rise due to concerns about rising interest expense and competition from higher-yielding fixed-income assets as well as cash-rich mega-cap stocks.That being said, the market's outlook is in the process of shifting. Recent economic data indicates a slowdown is in the works, with inflation cooling significantly, job growth slowing, and consumer spending likely nearing its limits.The Federal Reserve's preferred personal consumption expenditures price index reported a 3.44% inflation rate in September, reflecting a continued decline from its peak in July 2022. Moreover, the headline CPI number in October came in lower than expected at 3.24%, implying that the economy may be cooling even faster than was previously expected:Data by YChartsMoreover, the jobs market appears to be weakening. The recent U.S. jobs and wages data for October 2023 indicates that the job market may be weakening. For example, job growth slowed, with the 150,000 new jobs added falling short of expectations and marking a deceleration in employment gains. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate has also ticked up slightly to 3.9% while real wages have decreased by 5.8% compared to the previous year, signifying that wage growth is not keeping up with inflation.Last, but not least, U.S. consumer sentiment fell for the fourth consecutive month in November as the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index dropped to its lowest level since May. Moreover, when combined with the recent depletion of excess savings accumulated by U.S. households during the COVID-19 pandemic and a significant rise in consumer credit card debt (now at a record level of over $1 trillion), it appears likely that there will be a meaningful decrease in consumer spending moving forward.As a result of these factors, the Federal Reserve is very likely finished with hiking interest rates, and we expect that long and short-term interest rates are probably going to begin falling before too long. Moreover, the stock market will likely shift towards favoring more defensive stocks in the near future as the economy increasingly appears headed for a recession. This all points to a very bullish setup for defensive REITs, utilities, yield cos, and other businesses that have stable, contractual cash flows.While tech and broader index investors have had a great 2023 so far while dividend investors have generally been left behind, we believe that this is about to reverse in a big way as the market begins to shift its focus from higher for longer interest rates and the AI boom to falling interest rates and an impending recession. As a result, we expect the tech highflyers - including the Magnificent Seven - to materially underperform moving forward, while defensive REITs, utilities, yield cos, infrastructure companies, and other value-oriented dividend stocks outperform. As Billionaire \"Bond King\" Jeffrey Gundlach recently stated:[The Magnificent Seven] will obviously be the worst performers in the upcoming recession. Whatever is leading the charge going into the economic downturn invariably must lead the charge on the way down. I would get out of them.Instead, we are piling into investment grade, deeply undervalued, high-yielding names like Algonquin Power & Utilities (AQN), ATCO (OTCPK:ACLLF), Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP)(BEPC), Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (BIP)(BIPC), Enterprise Products Partners (EPD), Energy Transfer (ET), Crown Castle Inc. (CCI), and Realty Income (O). Each of these businesses generates very defensive contractual cash flows that should hold up quite well during a recession, offers a high yield, has a solid investment grade balance sheet, should benefit from falling interest rates, and has meaningful valuation multiple expansion potential.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

India is \u201cvery appealing\u201d from a demographics standpoint as it has a large, young population that\u2019s significantly educated, particularly in tech, said Jacobs.The BlackRock report says that U.S. demographics are at \u201can inflection point as we hit \u2018peak 65\u2019 \u2013 the largest number of people ever reaching traditional retirement age \u2013 and the \u2018Historical Reversal\u2019 \u2013 wherein the proportion of Americans aged 65 and older exceeds children under 15 for the first time.\u201d As the U.S. population ages, more Americans will experience age-related diseases, said BlackRock, pointing to \u201ca new era for medical innovation.\u201dAmong the funds investing in the medical-innovation theme are the BlackRock Future Health ETF BMED, iShares Biotechnology ETF IBB and iShares Neuroscience and Healthcare ETF IBRN, according to the report.\u201cThematic strategies are built using a tailored construction process to best capture\u201d each theme\u2019s \u201cvalue chain,\u201d BlackRock said. \u201cOwning a targeted basket of securities poised to benefit from the emergence of a theme can help investors capture thematic outperformance \u2013 even in a world where rates are higher for longer.\u201dCiting expanded U.S. export controls on chips, Alibaba said it won't spin off the business, which includes its AI efforts.Christine Idzelis is a markets reporter at MarketWatch and is based in New York.Visit a quote page and your recently viewed tickers will be displayed here.",

Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn MoreAs earnings season draws to a close, you might be wondering which stocks are worth doubling down on, or where you can find the most enticing growth prospects. Many on Wall Street have been sounding an alert for a new tech bull market thanks in large part to artificial intelligence (AI).The biggest technology companies in the world by market capitalization are collectively referred to as the \"Magnificent Seven\": Apple, Nvidia, Tesla, Amazon, (AMZN -0.67%), Microsoft (MSFT 1.70%), Alphabet (GOOG 1.64%) (GOOGL 1.63%), and Meta Platforms (META 0.07%). After digesting the most recent earnings reports for each, I believe that four of them look too good to pass up.Let's see why Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta not only look like great buys at the moment, but also are laying the groundwork for durable success. For long-term investors, these four AI leaders might just help someone reach millionaire status.Microsoft is best known for its Windows operating system and suite of productivity tools including Excel, PowerPoint, and Word. However, for the past several years, the company has been gaining momentum in cloud computing, spearheaded by its platform Azure. Earlier this year, Microsoft invested $10 billion in OpenAI and its flagship product ChatGPT. Over the last few months, Microsoft has started rolling out new features powered by OpenAI. In its most recent earnings report, the company reported 29% annual growth in Azure, with 3 percentage points of this growth driven by AI.For several months, the company has been preparing a new product, 365 Copilot, an AI-powered assistant using large language models and generative AI to integrate with Microsoft's various tools including search, cloud, and productivity applications. The commercial release is currently underway, with some on Wall Street thinking it could be a $100 billion opportunity for Microsoft.Following Microsoft's investment in OpenAI earlier this year, Alphabet quickly followed suit with a partnership with a rival start-up called Anthropic. For the last couple of quarters, Alphabet has been showing investors how its integrating AI into its core products, including advertising, cloud computing, and productivity tools.Advertising is the company's largest revenue and profit contributor. But its ad business was one of the bigger investor concerns for most of 2022, largely due to competing services like TikTok and Instagram.Growth was shrinking in advertising -- particularly on its video-sharing platform YouTube -- which was having a material effect on profitability, leaving some to wonder if the company's best days were behind it.But the last couple of quarters have contained a lot of bright spots. Advertising growth has started to rebound, which management attributes to inroads made with generative AI and how it's becoming a core pillar of advertising tools. Ad spending can be cyclical, so it is crucial that Alphabet shows its customers that it has the best capabilities in targeting ads to a specific demographic.One of the more encouraging points in the third-quarter earnings report was the growth in operating income for its services business, which is primarily made up of advertising. For the quarter, ended Sept. 30, operating margin for services was 35% -- an improvement from the prior year's 31%.The improving financial and operational picture at Alphabet is reason enough to be bullish. And given how early the company is in its AI deployment, the long-term prospects only make the story even more compelling.Image Source: Getty ImagesLike Alphabet, Amazon has built a business that gives investors exposure to many different industries.Amazon is best known for its e-commerce platform, but the company is the undisputed leader in cloud computing and has quietly built a budding advertising business. The biggest takeaway from its third-quarter report was that, as of now, the cloud business effectively has a $100 billion revenue run-rate.But management says the overwhelming bulk of enterprise IT spending is still captured by on-premise products. This means that as cloud applications become even more crucial for enterprises of all sizes, Amazon is in position to benefit from this shift in IT budgets.And like Alphabet, Amazon also is a big investor in Anthropic. As part of the deal, Anthropic will train future generative-AI models on Amazon's homegrown semiconductor chips and will use Amazon as its primary cloud provider. I think investors are discounting the benefits of this partnership and the opportunity for lead generation that Anthropic represents.Amazon's advertising business is also exciting. The company is leveraging AI to hone its ability to run targeted ad campaigns. As the holiday season approaches, these investments could be a bellwether for the e-commerce operation.Meta is home to social media applications Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. For much of 2022 and early 2023, Meta Platforms was under a lot of scrutiny after the company's core advertising business took a back seat to management's interest in the metaverse.Meta mistakenly allocated too many resources to its metaverse ambitions and lost sight of its core moneymaker. As growth in the advertising business stalled and expenses ballooned, profitability took a hit. Meta resorted to multiple rounds of layoffs to get costs under control as it sought to get its advertising revenue back on track.The third-quarter earnings report underscored how much progress Meta has made. Advertising revenue had its highest growth rate all year, and free cash flow is at levels not seen since 2021.Macroeconomic conditions might make some investors question the near-term outlook. This is a valid concern, but the analysis in the section below shows why investors should think about the long term.Data source: YCharts.The chart above illustrates the total return on a $50,000 investment in each of the four stocks over 10 years. Total return is an important metric for stocks because it accounts for dividend reinvestment. Microsoft is the only one of the Magnificent Seven that pays a dividend, and this is one reason its return has outpaced the other three in this group.If you're considering the stocks outlined above, a good strategy would be to dollar-cost average into each of them, as long as the core investment thesis remains intact. With each of these stocks trading for just a few hundred dollars, you can open positions in each for about $1,000. By doubling down on your winners over the long haul, the power of compounding will take effect, and you should see a meaningful return that just might make you a millionaire.Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn MoreThe tech industry has gained a reputation for being one of the best places to find reliable long-term investments. Many of the world's biggest tech companies, such as Apple (AAPL 0.76%), Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia (NVDA 0.45%), and others trade on the Nasdaq Stock Market rather than alternative U.S. exchanges.The chart below shows how the Nasdaq Composite has risen significantly higher than the NYSE Composite over the last five years. The Nasdaq's growth is primarily owed to tech companies, which regularly see significant gains.Data by YChartsTech companies profit immensely from the innovative nature of the market, benefiting from consistent demand for upgraded devices and software. As a result, the tech sector can be a fruitful area to hunt for investments. Here are two such stocks well worth considering for your portfolio now.As one of the biggest names in chips, Nvidia's stock is an excellent way to invest in and profit from growth in multiple areas of technologyThe company supplies its hardware to businesses across the industry, powering everything from laptops to cloud platforms, custom-built PCs, video game consoles, and more. Demand for chips is rising quickly as more companies require graphics processing units (GPUs) like Nvidia's to take their tech to the next level. As a result, Nvidia's stock has skyrocketed 840% over the last five years, alongside soaring demand for chips.Nvidia has become a favorite on Wall Street this year with its massive potential in artificial intelligence (AI). The AI market hit a value of $137 billion last year, and is projected to expand at a compound annual rate of 37% through 2030. Meanwhile, the company has snapped up about 90% of the market share in AI chips as interest in the technology has soared and GPUs have become crucial to building AI models.The company's success in the budding sector led to a glowing second quarter of 2024 (ended July 2023). Nvidia's revenue climbed 101% to $13.5 billion, with operating income rising over 1,200% as AI chip sales spiked.Nvidia has hit some roadblocks over the last year as rising tensions between the U.S. and China have meant increased sanctions on the sales of high-performance chips to the East Asian country. However, the company has been quick to react. Rather than losing out on a major market, Nvidia has developed three new chips tailored specifically for China that can meet the rising demand for AI in the region and comply with U.S. export controls.Nvidia has enjoyed immense growth over the last year but has shown no signs of slowing. Chip demand will likely continue rising over the long term, with Nvidia well-positioned to profit significantly as it does. Its stock is a solid buy for anyone looking for an investment to hold until retirement.Apple (AAPL 0.76%) hasn't had it easy this year. Macroeconomic headwinds have caught up with the company, causing significant reductions in consumer spending and sales declines across all four of its product segments in fiscal 2023. Revenue fell 3% year over year after net sales tumbled 2% in its iPhone segment (the highest-earning part of its business).The challenges have led to some pullback from investors, with Apple shares down 5% since the end of July. However, economic hurdles won't last forever, and the company's dominance in tech remains an attractive selling point over the long term. Apple holds leading market share in most of its product categories, with quickly expanding positions in digital services and AI.Despite market headwinds, Apple has actually grown its market share in smartphones this year as consumers have continued to prefer its products. From the first quarter of 2023 to Q3, Apple's market share grew from 52% to 55% (per Counterpoint Research). The company has gotten ahead by consistently outperforming its smartphone competitors. In Q3 2023, Samsung and Alphabet sales fell 26% and 37% as total U.S. shipments plunged 19%. However, Apple reported a more moderate decline of 11%.Moreover, the tech giant's booming services business has become its second-highest-earning division, and is outpacing its iPhone segment in growth. In fiscal 2023, services revenue rose 9% year over compared to the iPhone's decline of 2%. The digital business includes income from the App Store and its subscription-based platforms, which have proven far less vulnerable to economic declines than products. The segment's rapid growth bodes well for Apple over the long term as it will allow it to lean less on product sales, especially during temporary market declines.Apple shares have soared 265% since 2018, more than those of competitors like Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon. Despite recent hurdles, I wouldn't bet against its stock rising far higher over the next few decades as it expands in more digital markets and benefits from a recovery in the consumer tech market.John Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Learn MoreContrary to popular belief, one does not need much to begin investing. Even amounts such as $1,000 will not only get one started, but also buy whole shares of most of the stocks chosen by Warren Buffett's team at Berkshire Hathaway.This includes consumer-oriented stocks, and under current conditions, stocks like Apple (AAPL 0.80%), Amazon (AMZN -0.62%), and Floor & Decor (FND -1.58%) look like they are in an excellent position to serve investors well.When considering the stocks Warren Buffett owns, Apple almost has to be a choice, considering that it makes up nearly half of Berkshire Hathaway's stock portfolio. While people know it for many products, Apple derives the majority of its revenue from the iPhone.As that product matured, Apple pivoted into Apple Services, which includes Apple TV+, Apple Pay, and the Apple Card. These additions should help the company grow even if hardware sales begin to plateau.Additionally, few companies can match Apple in liquidity, which now stands at about $162 billion. This gives it one of the more stable balance sheets in existence.That solidity may even compensate for the fact that its net income of $97 billion for fiscal 2023 (ended Sept. 30) fell 3% from the previous fiscal year. Such a drop is unusual for Apple and is likely due to uncertainty in the economy.Still, amid these conditions, the stock is up 40% this year. And while its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 30 is significantly higher than the earnings multiples of the last decade, it prices the stock at a point where it can still benefit from growth once the economy improves.Amazon is another Berkshire investment that has served investors well. Investors know it best for pioneering e-commerce and later cloud computing. Moreover, as competitors emerged, Amazon has managed to maintain its lead in both industries.It has also prospered in a unique way. It is unclear if its online sales business, its largest revenue source, turns a profit. However, its e-commerce segments support subscription, reseller, and ad businesses, which likely drive a positive net income. Additionally, Amazon benefits from higher margins with the cloud computing segment Amazon Web Services (AWS). In most quarters, AWS drives the majority of its operating income.Despite its $1.5 trillion market cap, Amazon has returned to rapid profit growth. Net income for the first three quarters of 2023 was almost $20 billion, a dramatic turnaround from the $3 billion loss in the same period in 2022.That has brought about a significant recovery in the stock this year. And despite a recent 73 P/E ratio, its earnings multiple is near historical lows. This positions investors who follow Buffett's team in this stock to derive significant returns from a modest investment.Another consumer stock benefiting from a unique business model is Floor & Decor. Indeed, the regional to national expansion it is undergoing is usually good for stock market growth.However, Floor & Decor prospers by specializing in hard flooring and decor. It offers more variety than competitors such as Home Depot and cuts out the middleman by negotiating with the supplier directly. The more the company expands, the more power it holds to negotiate lower prices.Admittedly, rising operating costs have weighed on Floor & Decor. In the first three quarters of 2023, net income of $209 million dropped 9% from year-ago levels. This has occurred even as it earns more revenue due to the 17 additional stores it opened in the first nine months of the year.Unfortunately, relentless selling amid rising interest rates and worries about the economy wiped out most of the gains for this year. But its recent P/E ratio of 31 has been a historical low in this decade. When the flooring industry finally recovers, the retail stock will likely surge higher along with the economy.John Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

            "description": "Two strategies that require virtually no effort are generating more than $12 billion in yearly income for Buffett's company.Founded in 1993, The Motley Fool is a financial services company dedicated to making the world smarter, happier, and richer.

Learn MoreFor nearly six decades, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.51%) (BRK.B 0.60%) CEO Warren Buffett has been putting on a clinic for professional and everyday investors. Since taking over as CEO in the mid-1960s, he's overseen just shy of a 4,300,000% aggregate return in Berkshire's Class A shares (BRK.A) as of the closing bell on Nov. 10, 2023.The Oracle of Omaha's \"recipe\" for success is a regular topic of discussion. Typically, Buffett and his investment team gravitate to time-tested, profitable businesses with flexible balance sheets, strong brand names, and trusted management teams.But it also helps when your money is doing some of the heavy lifting. With minimal effort, Warren Buffett is overseeing the collection of more than $12 billion in annual income using two incredibly simple strategies that any investor can follow.Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.As of Nov. 10, Berkshire Hathaway's $350 billion investment portfolio consisted of more than 50 securities. A majority of the stakes Buffett's company holds are in businesses that pay a regular dividend. Although putting money to work in dividend stocks isn't fancy or groundbreaking, it tends to be a highly successful strategy for patient investors.Approximately 10 years ago, the wealth-management division of America's largest bank by assets, JPMorgan Chase, released a report that compared the performance of companies initiating and growing their payouts between 1972 and 2012 to publicly traded companies that don't offer a payout. Researchers found that the dividend payers produced an annualized return of 9.5% over four decades, while the non-payers generated annualized returns of a mere 1.6% over the same span.Since dividend stocks tend to be profitable on a recurring basis and time-tested, they're just the type of businesses a long-term investor like Warren Buffett will appreciate.Over the coming 12 months, Berkshire Hathaway is on pace to collect more than $6 billion in dividend income. Interestingly enough, nearly half of this dividend income ($2.83 billion) is expected to come from just three stocks:Money-center giant Bank of America is Berkshire's top income stock. Aside from being cyclical and enjoying disproportionately long periods of economic growth, Bank of America is perfectly positioned to benefit from a higher interest rate environment. No large U.S. bank is more interest-sensitive than BofA, with its net-interest income increasing by the billions each quarter relative to where things stood in 2021.Energy stock Occidental Petroleum has been one of Berkshire's top buys since the start of 2022. Though Buffett's company is generating close to $164.2 million in annual dividend income from the more than 228 million shares of common stock it owns in Occidental, the bulk ($800 million) derives from the $10 billion in Occidental preferred stock Berkshire holds yielding 8%. Berkshire received this preferred stock by handing over $10 billion to help fuel Occidental's acquisition of Anadarko in 2019.Meanwhile, Apple is a capital-return juggernaut. The $15 billion it parses out in dividends each year is second only to Microsoft. Furthermore, Apple has repurchased more than $600 billion worth of its common stock since its buyback program commenced in 2013.The point being that Warren Buffett is allowing his $350 billion investment portfolio to generate meaningful income for his company each year, and neither he nor his investment team have to lift a finger.Image source: Getty Images.However, owning dividend stocks isn't the only way the Oracle of Omaha and his team are generating embarrassingly easy income for Berkshire Hathaway.The company's recently filed third-quarter operating results show that Berkshire has more than $1 trillion in assets. Among its listed assets are $126.4 billion worth of \"short-term investments in U.S. Treasury bills.\"Treasury bills are U.S. government debt securities set to mature in four, 13, 26, or 52 weeks (one year). Whereas Treasury bonds and notes have fixed interest rates over a defined maturity timeline, Treasury bills are simply sold at a discount to their face value. When these short-term debt securities mature in a few weeks, months, or one year, the owner is made whole, generating a positive \"yield.\"3 Month Treasury Bill Rate data by YCharts.With the Federal Reserve forced to get aggressive to combat historically high inflation, Treasury debt securities have soared at least in relation to where they had been. This increase in yield has been particularly pronounced for short-term Treasury bills (T-Bills). Since the start of 2022, the yield on three-month T-Bills has jumped from 0.05% to around 5.3%.In other words, the historically high cash balance that Buffett and his investment team are sitting on is likely earning 5% (or perhaps slightly more) on an annualized basis. That's more than $6 billion in annual interest income with very minimal effort (i.e., placing the buy order when U.S. government debt securities are being sold).This is a particularly attractive approach at the moment given that stocks aren't cheap. Between Oct. 1, 2022 and Sept. 30, 2023, Buffett has overseen more than $38 billion in net-equity sales. Though he and his investing lieutenants (Todd Combs and Ted Weschler) are adding to some existing holdings, they've predominantly been net sellers as stock valuations have risen to historically unsustainable levels. Being able to collect an extremely safe 5% (or greater) yield, which currently tops the prevailing inflation rate, is an offer Warren Buffett is unlikely to turn down.JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America are advertising partners of The Ascent, a Motley Fool company.

Learn MoreWhen you think of successful companies and stocks, Apple (AAPL 0.76%) probably is one of the first to come to mind. The maker of the world-famous iPhone and a slew of other top products and services has seen its earnings climb into the billions of dollars over the past decade, and in more recent times, its market value soar into the trillions.So, adding Apple to your portfolio might seem like a great idea ahead of the next bull market. And it is, but a couple of other companies actually represent better buys for this next phase of market growth. They both are recovering from difficult times and may be entering a new era of growth, and this could supercharge their shares.All of this means, right now, you might want to forget Apple -- even if the Apple Watch is sitting right there on your wrist -- and instead try these two potential bull market winners.Image source: Getty Images.Amazon (AMZN -0.70%) had a tough time of it last year. The e-commerce and cloud computing giant reported its first annual loss in about a decade as higher inflation weighed on its costs and on its customers' buying power. On top of this, Amazon also had to deal with excess capacity across its fulfillment network.But Amazon worked to turn things around by making one important decision: The company decided to improve its cost structure, cutting tens of thousands of jobs, increasing efficiency, and shifting investment into high-growth areas.Amazon also has made other specific moves to benefit its businesses of e-commerce and cloud computing. For e-commerce, the company transitioned to a regional fulfillment model from a national one to increase package delivery speed and cut costs. For cloud computing, Amazon upped its investment in artificial intelligence (AI), a potentially revolutionary technology for that business.The efforts already are bearing fruit, with Amazon reporting a return to profit and positive free cash flow as well as revenue growth over the past two quarters. And Amazon stock has rallied, gaining nearly 70% so far this year.But as Amazon's cost structure improvements continue to develop and deliver results, I could see the stock climbing further in a bull market environment.Carnival Corp.'s (CCL 0.69%) problems started in the early days of the pandemic, when cruise ships were forced to halt operations. That resulted in earnings plunging into negative territory and debt ballooning to a peak of $34 billion.Since, the company has benefited from two things: its work to cut costs and increase revenue opportunities and the general rebound in demand for cruise vacations. Carnival has taken steps such as replacing older ships with newer, more fuel-efficient ones. And the company offers bundled packages to travelers prior to their cruise -- to get more onboard spend on the books ahead of sailings.So far, things are looking good. Just recently, Carnival reported records in both revenue and total customer deposits. The company also beat its guidance range for U.S. net income under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the third quarter and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). And, importantly, the ongoing growth in adjusted free cash flow should help Carnival pay down debt.Like Amazon, Carnival has seen its shares take off, climbing nearly 60% since the start of the year. But it's important to remember they're far from their pre-pandemic levels -- and at the same time, revenue is climbing.CCL data by YChartsCarnival's recovery efforts and the rebound in demand clearly could power earnings in the coming quarters -- and that may translate into a soaring stock price.It's hard to forget about a company that seems to be everywhere these days, from your wrist to your TV screen. And there's reason to be optimistic about Apple's earnings and share price over the long haul. This market leader even looks reasonably priced today due to its bright long-term outlook.So, I wouldn't avoid Apple shares. But if you want to stock up on stocks that may truly take off in the next bull market, Amazon and Carnival could be your best bets. Thanks to their recent recovery efforts, they have what it takes to lead the next wave of market gains.John Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

But it sold off small holdings of some of the largest \u2014 like Nvidia Corp. and Microsoft Corp. \u2014 as well as electric-vehicle maker Rivian Automotive. According to a filing on Tuesday, the firm during the third quarter bought up 325,000 shares of chip designer Arm Holdings ARM, -2.74%, which went public in September, for $17.4 million. It also bought smaller stakes in recent IPOs such as Maplebear Inc. CART, -3.59%, better known as grocery-delivery platform Instacart, and digital-marketing firm Klaviyo Inc. KVYO, -6.69%.

            "title": "Why a derailed $11 trillion corporate bond market looks ripe for a comeback as U.S. inflation slows",
            "description": "Bonds issued by America's most valuable companies are steaming ahead after sinking to their lowest prices in about 20 years.Slowing U.S. inflation has sparked hopes of a big turnaround for hard-hit parts of the $10.6 trillion U.S. corporate bond market.Bonds issued by America\u2019s most valuable companies, from Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.70% to Amazon.com AMZN, -0.57% to Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +1.55% to Johnson & Johnson, JNJ, +0.24% have been trading at some of their lowest prices in nearly two decades, a casualty of the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate hikes in the past 18 months. Prices for low-coupon, longer duration bonds have been hit particularly hard since the Fed began quickly lifting its policy rate last year from a 0%-0.25% pandemic range.Rate hikes make older, low-coupon bonds less valuable because major corporations and the U.S. government have been issuing newer bonds, often at yields not seen since the 2007-2008 global financial crisis. \u201cSo many investors got blindsided by the drop in value, and there really wasn\u2019t any place to hide,\u201d said Collin Martin, fixed income strategist at Schwab Center for Financial Research, in a phone interview.To help gauge the carnage, BondCliq Media Services put together a hypothetical long-duration, high quality, U.S. corporate bond portfolio with a January 2022 starting value of almost $1 million. They also tracked the effect of Fed hiked rates (see black lines) since the Spring of 2022. While rising off the recent October lows, its value on Tuesday was pegged around $650,000.\u201cGiven the Fed outlook, it\u2019s more likely that prices rise over the next 12 months than fall,\u201d Martin said, adding that Schwab expects the next move from the Fed to be an interest rate cut, rather than a hike, given that inflation has continued to slowly recede from peak levels.The roughly 6.5-year ICE BofA US Corporate bond index was last pegged at a 87.31 price, up from as low as 85 in October, but on pace for a 1% total return for the year, according to FactSet. Lower bond prices matter for investors if they are forced to mark down their holdings or need to sell at a loss, a factor that contributed to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March. U.S. bond yields tumbled on Tuesday, and the stock-market SPX roared higher after the consumer-price index for October rose less than expected, pegging inflation at an annual rate of 3.2%, down from 3.7% in September.While that\u2019s still above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, traders on Tuesday were pricing in 50 basis points of cuts to the central bank\u2019s policy rate by July of 2024, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\u201cThe broad market consensus is now in line with our own expectation that the least Fed rate hike of the cycle occurred this summer,\u201d said BCA Researchers, in a client note Tuesday.Price fluctuations for bonds matter less if the debt is held to maturity, and fully repays at par, or $100, as promised. Like in stocks, investors want to buy bonds priced at steep discounts that look poised to rally.

The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, which tracks the S&P 500 Information Technology sector, was up 1.8% in recent trade, leaving it on track to finish at $181.47 a share, what would be its highest closing level ever recorded, according to Dow Jones Market Data. It\u2019s most recent record close arrived on July 18, according to Dow Jones data.

Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn MoreBerkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett has famously shied away from technology stocks for much of his career. He has given several explanations (and expressed a modicum of regret) for passing on opportunities like Microsoft and Alphabet, but they all amount to the same thing. Technology companies are generally outside his realm of expertise.However, Buffett began to redefine his circle of competence about a decade ago when Berkshire took a substantial stake in IBM in 2011. Berkshire has since exited that position, but it laid the foundation for another one: Apple (AAPL 0.75%). As of Sept. 30, Berkshire Hathaway had 49% of its $318 billion equity securities portfolio invested in this single technology stock.The prevailing consensus is that Buffett was not the original decision-maker when Berkshire first bought shares in 2016. That distinction probably lies with his co-investment managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler.But there can be no question that Buffett has a high conviction now about Apple, based on Berkshire's huge asset allocation. As Buffett said earlier this year: \"Apple is different than the other businesses we own. It just happens to be a better business.\"Given his conviction, is Apple stock worth buying today?Buffett sees a durable competitive advantage as the most important quality a business can possess, and Apple has that in spades. It ranks as the second-most-valuable brand in the world in 2023, according to consultancy Brand Finance, and its brand authority is the source of tremendous consumer loyalty and pricing power.Buffett called attention to those qualities during a CNBC interview earlier this year: \"If you're an Apple user and somebody offers you $10,000, but the only proviso is they'll take away your iPhone and you'll never be able to buy another, you're not going to take it.\" Not many companies have a product that is so highly prized among consumers.Apple has earned a strong market presence in several consumer electronics verticals. First and foremost, it is the largest smartphone manufacturer in the U.S. (55% market share in the third quarter) and the second-largest worldwide (16% market share in the third quarter). Apple is also the fourth-largest personal computer (PC) manufacturer, and it leads the market in tablets and smartwatches.That creates a path to mid-single-digit growth in device revenue in the coming years as the broader consumer electronics market is expected to grow at 6.6% annually through 2030, according to Grand View Research.But Apple has an installed base north of 2 billion active devices, which creates a monetization opportunity via services like App Store sales, financial products (Apple Pay), and various subscription products like Apple Music. The company has a strong presence in a few of those markets. Most notably, Apple Pay is the most popular in-store mobile wallet among U.S. consumers, and the App Store earns twice as much revenue as its closest competitor, the Google Play Store.That creates a path to low-double-digit growth in services revenue in the coming years as mobile app sales are expected to increase at 9% annually through 2027 and the U.S. mobile payments market is projected to increase at 13% annually over the same period.Apple beat expectations on the top and bottom lines in the fiscal fourth quarter (ended Sept. 30), but the results were mediocre at best. Total revenue fell for the fourth consecutive quarter, dropping about 70 basis points. That decline was due primarily to a 34% drop in Mac sales and a 10% decline in iPad sales. But meager 3% growth in iPhone sales certainly didn't help the situation.On the bright side, Apple reported 16% sales growth in its high-margin services business, and the company repurchased more than $15 billion in stock during the quarter. As a result, GAAP earnings increased 13% to $1.46 per diluted share.Apple is a well-managed business that has consistently created value for shareholders. The stock is up 271% over the last five years, nearly quadrupling the S&P 500's total return. But I am skeptical as to whether the company can deliver market-beating returns from its current valuation.Apple stock trades at just under 30 times earnings, a premium to its five-year average of 25.8 times earnings. Worse yet, Wall Street expects Apple to grow earnings per share at 9.8% annually over the long term. That forecast makes its current valuation multiple look expensive.Personally, I would wait for a cheaper price. But Buffett clearly has immense confidence in the company, so I certainly wouldn't fault investors for buying a small position in Apple stock today.Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn MoreDo you prefer a more passive, long-term approach to investing that doesn't require constant monitoring and updating of your portfolio? That's fine. In fact, it's great. Investors employing a simpler \"less is more\" approach often end up outperforming their peers.The key to success with such a strategy is just finding the right stocks to begin with. If you are just starting out as an investor but only have so much available to invest -- say $500 -- you want to start out with solid choices you know will do well so you can grow that initial investment. You also need to know these choices will be fine in the long run, and able to shrug off any short-term challenges.With that as the backdrop, here's a rundown of five different stocks you can confidently invest $500 in right now and not worry about them too much for the next several years.You've heard of the company. And you're likely to also be a customer without even realizing it. Procter & Gamble (PG 0.73%) is parent to several popular brands of consumer goods, including Tide laundry detergent, Gillette razors, Luvs and Pampers diapers, Cascade dishwasher detergent, Bounty paper towels, and more.Its products aren't just familiar, either. In market research outfit BrandSpark's most recent look at the market, Procter & Gamble boasted a leading 23 of the country's most trusted brand names; Tide alone won in five different laundry categories.This is no small matter. See, although brand recognition alone doesn't inherently guarantee profitability, market dominance goes a long way in ensuring a leading brand remains a leading brand. Not only does Procter & Gamble enjoy all the advantages of scale, like relatively lower production and operating costs as well as sales leverage with retailers, but it also simply has more products to cross-sell. P&G can also afford to be one of the world's biggest advertisers.Connect the dots. It's unlikely Procter & Gamble is going to be dethroned anytime soon, if ever.Here's another company that doesn't need much of an introduction. Apple (AAPL 0.74%), of course, makes the world's single most popular smartphone -- the iPhone. Yes, Samsung technically sells more total smartphones, but in a variety of models and price ranges. Apple also generates far more smartphone revenue than any of its rivals due to the iPhone's premium pricing.Loyalty to the iOS operating system powering iPhones is sky-high, too, with market research firm Consumer Intelligence Research Partners reporting that 94% of iOS users (most of them being iPhone users) plan on sticking with the operating system when it's time to upgrade their devices. Consumer Intelligence Research Partners adds that between early last year and early this year, 15% of iPhone purchases made within the United States were made by former users of Samsung's Android smartphones. Both measures are far stronger than Android's appeal and loyalty.Although the iPhone is a powerhouse product accounting for more than half of the company's revenue, it's not the only reason to step into Apple for the long haul. The popular device is increasingly a means to an end, generating additional revenue by facilitating the sale of apps, music, and video entertainment. These digital services now account for around one-fourth of Apple's top line and even more of its bottom line.Apps and subscriptions only fuel consumer loyalty to Apple's iOS digital ecosystem, of course. People are not only already familiar with the operating system, but they've already paid for many of the apps installed on previous versions of their smartphones.This is yet another company you're more than familiar with. Visa (V -0.24%) is the world's biggest credit card middleman (outside of China, anyway), handling the purchase of $14.8 trillion worth of goods and services in its recently ended fiscal year. That's more than 259 billion total transactions from a crowd wielding more than 4 billion Visa credit and debit cards.Visa's sheer reach is only half the reason to own the stock, however. The other half is the way consumer spending is evolving. Cash is slowly but surely going away, displaced by cards. The U.S. Federal Reserve reports that back in 2012, cash was used to handle 40% of purchases made within the United States. Now, that number has been dialed back to only 18%. During this time, debit and credit card usage has grown from 44% of transactions to 60%.Yet, there's room remaining for both of these trends to continue.This shift, of course, reflects the growing convenience of cards and the growing inconvenience of paper and coins. It's now common within the United States to purchase things like groceries or even pay your wireless phone bill with a credit card, and more so every day.Visa may never be a high-growth stock. As long as sellers and buyers want to connect with one another, though, Visa's service will be a necessary one.You probably know the name as the developer of image-editing software Photoshop or the premier name in digital PDF (portable document file) solutions. And it still offers both.However, Adobe (ADBE 1.14%) is so much more than Photoshop and PDFs. The company offers a full-blown suite of digital tools aimed at the business market. Stock photography, generative AI, 3D modeling, animation, web traffic analytics, e-commerce tools, targeted marketing, and digital data collection (and more) are all in its wheelhouse now.That's not the evolution that makes Adobe such a worry-free investment, though. You can confidently pour at least a portion of your idle cash into it at this time because of the way it now offers its software to customers. While you can still purchase it outright on a one-time basis, most users now opt for the subscription-based, cloud-accessed versions of its tools. Not only are these tools always up to date and accessible from anywhere, but this model is also often more cost-effective for the end-user. It's good for Adobe and its investors, too, as recurring revenue is also predictable revenue.To this end, Adobe's annualized recurring revenue run rate now stands at $14.6 billion, while $15.7 billion worth of this business is already lined up and waiting to be booked. For perspective, Adobe has done about $18.9 billion worth of business over the course of the past four quarters.Last but not least, add Coca-Cola (KO -0.32%) to your list of stocks you can confidently step into right now.Like Adobe, Procter & Gamble, Apple, and Visa, the big draw here is once again the habitual, recurring purchase of its products -- all of them. Yes, there's its market-leading namesake cola. The company isn't just carbonated beverages, though. This is also the name behind Dasani water, Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, and others. It's always got a beverage product to sell someone.The key selling feature of Coca-Cola stock, however, is its dividend. The current dividend yield is a healthy 3.2%, but more than that, it's a dividend that's been raised every single year for the past 61 years.Don't look for this streak to be snapped anytime soon, either. See, the beverage giant has spent the past several years selling its bottling operations back to local bottlers so it can better focus on what it does best. That's marketing and licensing its flavors and brand names. And it's very, very good at it; there's a reason brand names and their corresponding brand logos are among the most recognized in the world. While this strategic shift means less net revenue, since profit margins on royalties are much higher than margins on bottling, The Coca-Cola Company is actually set to make more net income now than it was earning then.KO Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts.As the chart above also illustrates, Coca-Cola is making far more than enough money to continue funding its dividend.

            "description": "Bank of America says investors are betting big on Fed easing for 2024.Better-than-expected CPI is set to light a fuse under Wall Street stocks, as some see it as helping keep the Fed in its perceived no-more-hike box. With bond yields the data may also keep driving that end-year equity rally theory. Onto our call of the day, from Bank of America, which talks about where the majority of investors expect the 2024 \u201cplaybook\u201d for investing to go \u2014 and much of that has to do with a Federal Reserve backing off interest rates.In its global fund manager survey for November, strategist Michael Hartnett and his team explain that investors have turned cautious on the macro picture.So most expect a soft landing for the economy \u2014 interest rate hikes that have worked to slow the economy just enough, but not into a recession \u2014 lower rates, a weaker dollar and a continued bull market for large-cap tech stocks.Read: What\u2019s driving Wall Street\u2019s gloomiest interest-rate forecastA net 76% of those surveyed believe the Federal Reserve hiking cycle is over, and 61% expect lower bond yields, which as the below chart shows, is the most on record: And that\u2019s despite the second highest number of investors ever saying fiscal policy was too stimulative, the survey finds.The survey also shows investors have trimmed their cash levels to a two-year low of 4.7% from 5.3%, and moved to the biggest bond overweight since March 2009. And as part of that view the Fed is done hiking, investors flipped to their first equity overweight since April 2022.Now, if the economy goes against the general thinking here and a \u201chard landing\u201d or sharp slowdown kicks in, then a contrarian investor would want to be bullish on cash, short on U.S. growth stocks and Japan equities. they say. And in the case of \u201cno landing\u201d and higher interest rates, then long cash, dollar and commodities is the contrarian bet to make. Hartnett and co. also laid out what they believe is the biggest contrarian play of 2024 \u2014 \u201clong leverage, short quality.\u201d While he doesn\u2019t quite break this down, sometimes but not always, leverage can refer to companies that need to borrow money, so this would imply a bullish bet on that group. But a bullish bet on those would mean no fear of an imminent credit event, that Hartnett has discussed in recent months.As for short quality?

Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn MoreInvestors love to follow what stock Warren Buffett and his team buy for his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway. His stock picks make waves in the investing world and can move the entire market.But not all of his picks become popular stocks or become long-term winners. And even though he's rigorous about researching companies he wants to invest in and has said his favorite holding period is \"forever,\" when the time is right, he has no qualms about selling.Although he gives out advice freely and frankly, he rarely gives details about specific stocks. But there's one investment he's told followers over and over again to put their money in and to never bet against, and it just did something in 2023 that should give investors some confidence about its future.The investment I'm talking about isn't Apple, Coca-Cola, or Berkshire Hathaway stock itself. It's the S&P 500, and outside the individual stocks in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio, Berkshire owns 43,000 shares of the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO -0.14%). That's worth around $17 million at today's price, a drop in the bucket of the entire portfolio that's worth about $346 billion today.Berkshire Hathaway isn't an amateur investor. It's very actively invested. So why does it own index funds?It's not easy to beat the market, even though Buffett has done it. In bull markets, more than 80% of actively invested mutual funds could underperform the market. In 2021, 85% underperformed. Not surprisingly, it's easier to beat the market when the market is down, and only 54% of actively invested mutual funds underperformed the S&P 500 in 2022. That's still more than half.In his most recent shareholder letter, Buffett described what he calls \"the American tailwind.\" It's not the first time he's talked about his confidence in the future of the U.S., and he attributed his company's success to the promise and initiative of the country.The S&P 500 is a collection of some of the largest, most popular companies in the U.S., and altogether they drive a huge amount of the American economy. These are the companies that will be around in the future and drive economic recovery, as well as create new opportunities and future growth.Buffett said: \"I have yet to see a time when it made sense to make a long-term bet against America. And I doubt very much that any reader of this letter will have a different experience in the future.\" To that end, he has said that he's putting 90% of his individual portfolio into index funds for his wife after he dies.Buffett actually made a bet with a large, well-known hedge fund to test out how well investing in an S&P 500 index fund stacks up against elite stock pickers. Buffett and five select fund managers each invested the same amount over 10 years, Buffett in an index fund, and the five managers each chose their stocks, buying and selling over the time frame.These were the results, ended in 2017:Data source: Berkshire Hathaway letter to shareholders, 2017.Getting back to what the market did, it just posted its best week of 2023. The year started on a high note, with investors pushing up the market to within striking distance of ending the bear market. But after gloomy economic reports and no easing up on interest rates, the market fell.However, the most recent slate of company earnings reports illustrated that the economy is doing better than expected, and the market rallied last week. Many individual stocks soared, and the S&P 500 is now up 15% year to date.We don't know where the market is going next, but if history is any guide it will continue to rise and create wealth over time. Even if you are choosing your own stocks, it's a good idea to having some funds put away in an index fund or ETF to further diversify your holdings and provide value. If you haven't done this yet, now is a great time.Jennifer Saibil has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn MoreFor well over a century, Wall Street has provided a pathway for everyday investors to build their wealth. The annualized returns for the iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI -0.41%), benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC -0.13%), and growth-fueled Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC -0.13%) have easily outpaced the annualized returns of bonds, housing, and commodities spanning multiple decades.However, short-term directional moves in the major stock indexes are considerably harder to predict as evidenced by all three major indexes vacillating back and forth between bull and bear markets since this decade began.Image source: Getty Images.Though there's no perfect blueprint or concrete formula that can accurately tell investors what's to come for the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite, there is certainly an abundance of breadcrumbs for investors to follow. One of these proverbial breadcrumbs has seen the broad-based S&P 500 make history in a way that's traditionally been bad news for Wall Street.Since 1957, the S&P, as we know it today, has contained 500 components. Having 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the index arguably provides a better barometer of Wall Street's health than the Dow or Nasdaq Composite.However, the above statement only holds true if the S&P 500 is getting fair representation from all of its components. Although it's a market cap-weighted index, and it certainly makes sense for larger businesses to have more \"say\" in the overall direction of the S&P 500, a top-heavy index has rarely, if ever, been a good thing for Wall Street or investors.Since 2023 began, the \"Magnificent Seven\" have done most of the heavy lifting for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. The Magnificent Seven are comprised of Apple (AAPL 0.75%), Microsoft (MSFT 1.68%), Amazon, Alphabet, Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and Tesla. But the representation from the largest two components -- Apple and Microsoft -- is what's rightly turning heads.The top 2 stocks in the S&P 500 (Apple & Microsoft) now represent a combined 14.4% of the index, the highest weighting for any two companies with data going back to 1980. pic.twitter.com/M75Vpa3lo4 As you can see in the post above by Charlie Bilello, the chief market strategist at Creative Planning, Wall Street's dynamic duo has made history. When Bilello posted this chart on Nov. 7, Apple and Microsoft collectively accounted for 14.4% of the S&P 500's weighting, which is an all-time record. As of the closing bell on Nov. 10, 2023, this weighting had expanded to nearly 14.7%.On a correlative basis, previous peaks in the weighting of the S&P 500's top-two holdings have preceded stock market corrections, such as in 1982, or bear markets, like the steep decline witnessed during the financial crisis in 2008.To be abundantly clear, a top-heavy S&P 500 isn't, in itself, a reason for the broader market to head lower. Rather, it's that the companies with the highest weightings have far less wiggle room to fail. If Apple and/or Microsoft were to disappoint investors with their future growth prospects, it would be a recipe for a stock-market correction given their outsized weightings.On one hand, Microsoft has continued to fire on all cylinders. The company's cloud-infrastructure service segment, Azure, is gaining market share on Amazon Web Services (AWS). But it's a different story for Apple, which is near the top-end of its valuation range dating back to 2011.Although Apple narrowly avoided a year-over-year earnings decline in fiscal 2023 (Apple's fiscal year ended on Sept. 30, 2023), sales for iPhone, Mac, iPad, and wearables all declined from the prior-year period. With Apple's growth engine stalled at the moment, it and the S&P 500 are vulnerable to downside.Image source: Getty Images.Considering what's happened previously when the S&P 500 has been highly concentrated, and taking into account a handful of metrics and predictive indicators that suggest the U.S. economy could be headed for a recession, the next couple of months or quarters may be challenging for traders. For patient investors, however, it'll just mark another period of opportunity to grow their wealth.As much as investors may dislike the unpredictability and velocity of downside moves in the stock market, corrections and bear markets are a normal and inevitable part of the long-term investing cycle. Based on data provided by sell-side consultancy firm Yardeni Research, there have been 39 corrections in the S&P 500 totaling 10% or more since the start of 1950. On average, investors are navigating a double-digit pullback in the broad-market indexes every 1.9 years.But just as corrections are inevitable, so are long-winded periods of expansion for the stock market.In June, investment analysis company Bespoke Investment Group released data that examined the average length of bull and bear markets for the S&P 500 dating back to the start of the Great Depression in September 1929. Whereas the 27 bear markets studied lasted an average of 286 calendar days, the 27 bull markets clocked in at an average length of 1,011 calendar days.^SPX data by YCharts.All told, there have been eight bull markets since 1942 that have lasted between four and 12 years. Furthermore, 13 bull markets since 1935 have lasted longer than the lengthiest bear market on record (630 calendar days, Jan. 11, 1973 to Oct. 3, 1974), according to Bespoke's dataset.However, the most convincing dataset that demonstrates the value of time for investors comes courtesy of Crestmont Research. The researchers at Crestmont examined the rolling 20-year total returns, including dividends, of the S&P 500. Since most S&P components could be found in other indexes prior to its inception in 1923, researchers were able to back-test their dataset to 1900, yielding 104 rolling 20-year periods (1919 to 2022).What Crestmont's dataset showed was that all 104 rolling 20-year periods generated a positive total return. Hypothetically speaking, it wouldn't have mattered if an investor purchased at the peak or perfectly timed a trough; they would have made a positive total return if they simply held onto an S&P 500 tracking index for 20 years.Though periods of high concentration for the major stock indexes have, historically, not been particularly good news for Wall Street, it's tough not to be excited about the future given the extensive amount of data that supports long-term, optimistic investors.John Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

            "description": "The 2024 Toyota Grand Highlander Hybrid is the most fuel-efficient version of the company\u2019s newest and roomiest\u00a03-row\u00a0midsize SUV. Pricing starts at $44,670.The 2024 Toyota Grand Highlander Hybrid is the most fuel-efficient version of the company\u2019s newest and roomiest 3-row midsize SUV. Pricing starts at $44,670.A 3-row SUV from Toyota TM, +0.38% already seems like a no-brainer. Then add a fuel-sipping hybrid drivetrain, an area of technology where Toyota has been both a pioneer and paradigm, and we\u2019re reaching for our wallets. But there\u2019s more. More space for passengers in the second and third rows, plus a generous cargo area \u2014 all greater than the usual-sized Highlander.It has to be said that the not-grand Highlander does lose out to most rivals in terms of interior space. This new-for-2024 Grand Highlander puts Toyota right back into contention.The regular, non-hybrid Grand Highlander is reviewed separately.What\u2019s new for 2024The Grand Highlander Hybrid is an all-new model in the larger Grand Highlander range. Although it shares a name with the usual Highlander, this vehicle has its own styling and is built on a different platform.The 2024 Toyota Grand Highlander Hybrid starts at $44,670. That\u2019s for the XLE trim with front-wheel drive. All-wheel drive is an extra $1,600.These are the manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail prices, and do not include the $1,395 factory-to-dealer delivery fee (destination charge).Non-hybrid contenders like the Kia 000270, +3.68% Telluride, Hyundai 005380, +1.26% Palisade, Honda HMC, +0.19% Pilot, and Chevrolet Traverse all start in the mid-to-high 30s. If a Highlander Hybrid (not Grand) turns out to be sufficiently spacious, it starts in the low 40s. And the combustion-only Grand Highlander kicks off at around $43K.See: Value, space, styling, safety: The 2024 Kia Telluride is tops in the 3-row midsize SUV classBefore buying a new Grand Highlander Hybrid SUV, check the Kelley Blue Book Fair Purchase Price to know what you should pay. We fully expect the Grand Highlander Hybrid will enjoy the same above-average resale values as its slightly smaller stablemate.The XSE and Limited models have a 245-horsepower hybrid drivetrain as standard. Thanks to the low-end thrust provided by the electric motor, the Grand Highlander Hybrid is a little quicker than its combustion-only counterpart, running from a standstill to 60 mph in about seven seconds. We\u2019ve found the 2024 Grand Highlander smooth and steady on the highway and easy around town, although its plus-size proportions can make parking lots feel a bit tighter.While most of our editors would go with the regular hybrid powertrain \u2014 even over the all-gas Grand Highlander \u2014 buyers planning to haul full loads of people, gear, or a trailer might want to consider the more muscular 362-horsepower Hybrid Max drivetrain.We\u2019ve spent hundreds of hours driving and evaluating this generation of 3-row SUVs, including the Toyota Grand Highlander.You might like: The new 2023 Honda Pilot is bigger, more powerful and now has a rugged off-road model, tooThe Grand Highlander Hybrid makes a strong case for itself here. The entry-level hybrid system in the entry-level XLE trim achieves 36 combined mpg (37 city, 34 highway) with front-wheel drive (FWD) or 34 combined mpg (36 city, 32 highway) with all-wheel drive (AWD).The Limited trim has AWD as standard and posts 33 combined mpg (35 city, 31 highway).The powerful Max hybrid drivetrain \u2014 which is standard in the top Platinum trim, optional in the Limited, and comes with AWD \u2014 runs to 27 combined mpg (26 city, 27 highway).For comparison, those figures are about as good as the smaller and less powerful Kia Sorento Hybrid, which manages 37 combined mpg (FWD) or 35 combined mpg (AWD).Be sure to read: The 2024 Mazda CX-90 PHEV vs. the Toyota Grand Highlander Hybrid: Here\u2019s how these two newcomers match upIn most reviews, we\u2019d start this section at the front and work toward the back. But since one of the Grand Highlander Hybrid\u2019s main reasons for existence is found rearward, let\u2019s flip the script.The cargo room behind the third row is 20.6 cubic feet, space enough to hold up to 12 carry-on suitcases (1.6 cubic feet each). Fold down the second and third rows for a maximum of 97.5 cubic feet, enough to hold more than 60 carry-on suitcases (if that\u2019s your idea of fun). The un-Grand equivalent goes from 16 to 84.3 cubic feet.However, the Grand Highlander Hybrid does not beat all comers if we study non-hybrid alternatives. The Chevy Traverse manages 23 to 98.2 cubic feet. And although the Kia Telluride doesn\u2019t match the Toyota\u2019s maximum, it has 21 cubic feet behind its third row.The third row is generously sized: 33.5 inches of rear legroom outdoes all the class except for the Traverse, which matches the Toyota to the tenth. The Grand Highlander Hybrid compares favorably to the Highlander\u2019s 28 inches.The 2024 Grand Highlander Hybrid offers a choice of seating in the second row. A pair of captains\u2019 chairs are standard, resulting in a maximum occupant count of seven. The XLE and Limited offer a 3-person bench, turning this hybrid SUV into an 8-seater. The Max Limited and Max Platinum are 7-seaters exclusively.Maximum legroom here is 39.5 inches, almost an inch better than the regular Highlander. The Sorento Hybrid, Telluride, and Pilot are more accommodating, but that\u2019s still a decent amount for an adult of average size. One thing that both the Grand Highlander Hybrid and its smaller counterpart have in common is finicky folding for rows two and three.Comparing the Grand Highlander Hybrid to the regular Grand Highlander, there are no compromises to accommodate the extra hardware. All these interior dimensions are the same.In the front row, the new Grand Highlander Hybrid has a 12.3-inch infotainment touchscreen, individual armrests, three drinks holders (including one for a large bottle), and wireless charging. The cabin has seven USB-C ports, 10 more cup holders, and plenty of nooks for stowing things.Also see: 15 full-size SUVs with the most cargo spaceA midsize SUV expanded for more rear space might sound like a recipe for odd proportions, but the 2024 Grand Highlander Hybrid gets the aesthetics right and has a good chance of aging well. The styling is distinct, not just an adjusted version of the regular Highlander. Yet there are still clever touches like the wide rear passenger doors contributing to easy third-row access. At just under 17 feet, the Grand Highlander Hybrid is about nine inches longer than the regular Highlander, with about four inches going into the wheelbase (the distance between the front and rear axles). It\u2019s also a couple of inches wider, and the roof is a couple of inches higher \u2014 ground clearance is the same.Infotainment systemWe like Toyota\u2019s infotainment setups. They\u2019re easy to use. The one in the Grand Highlander Hybrid has voice activation (say, \u201cHey, Toyota,\u201d then give a command), over-the-air updates, plus wireless Apple AAPL, +0.69% CarPlay and Android Auto.Smart KeyA standard feature, this allows access to the Grand Highlander Hybrid using a phone app. A conventional key is not necessary.Facial recognitionWith different drivers using the same vehicle, facial recognition can perceive each and dial in preferred settings like cabin temperature and audio settings.360-degree camera systemAlso known as the Panoramic View Monitor, it gives drivers a bird\u2019s-eye view of the vehicle\u2019s surroundings when maneuvering. Exclusive to the Platinum trim.Digital rearview mirrorWhen there\u2019s an SUV full of people and stuff, it\u2019s reassuring to have a clear view behind without even the rear pillars getting in the way. This feature in the Platinum trim shows the feed from a wide-angle rear-facing camera.Traffic Jam AssistPart of the Platinum trim, this feature can take care of the steering, throttle, and brakes at speeds up to 25 mph and when certain conditions are met.The 2024 Grand Highlander Hybrid offers a choice of two drivetrains. The XLE and Limited\u2019s setup consists of a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine augmented by an electric motor to generate 245 hp. The regular non-hybrid GH has 265 hp, but a little sacrifice for lower emissions isn\u2019t so bad.The most potent Hybrid Max configuration is available in the Limited trim and standard in the top Platinum trim, developing 362 hp from an electric motor and a turbocharged 2.4-liter 4-cylinder gasoline engine. Unusually, Toyota also quotes a torque figure for this drivetrain, a meaty 400 lb-ft of it.The smaller hybrid comes with FWD as standard, with the option of AWD on the XLE. AWD is standard on the Limited. Each uses a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT). The Max has AWD as standard, along with a 6-speed automatic transmission.The Max drivetrain achieves a maximum towing capacity of 5,000 pounds. The more modest version can still handle 3,500 pounds.Toyota\u2019s new-vehicle warranty conforms to the class norms of three years or 36,000 miles, whichever happens first, with powertrains covered for five years or 60,000 miles. Hybrid batteries have 10 years or 150,000 miles warranties, whereas the typical arrangement is eight years or 100,000 miles. Toyota also includes complimentary scheduled maintenance and roadside assistance over the first two years or 25,000 miles.Be sure to read: These are 2023\u2019s safest new carsCrash-test results have been reported by neither the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration nor the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety at the time of this review. Still, we expect it will take top scores like its smaller Highlander stablemate. Standard safety features include forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking and pedestrian/cyclist/motorcyclist detection, plus blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, lane departure alert with steering assistance, and adaptive cruise control.KBB\u2019s car review methodology.This story originally ran on KBB.com.\"My husband and I jointly own our home and have both equally contributed to the mortgage and household bills for the past 23 years.\"Visit a quote page and your recently viewed tickers will be displayed here.",

            "title": "Here\u2019s what could be different about Black Friday this year",
            "description": "Here\u2019s what marketing, retail and supply chain experts expect for Black Friday 2023 regarding spending, sales, deliveries and making returns.This article is reprinted by permission from NerdWallet. Black Friday is Nov. 24 this year. Retailers thrive on tantalizing shoppers ahead of the post-Thanksgiving event, keeping them guessing about how exactly the experience will unfold. But economic conditions, past sales and other factors can provide clues about what\u2019s to come.Here\u2019s what marketing, retail and supply chain experts expect for Black Friday 2023.\u201cA lot of macroeconomic indicators are pointing to a big slowdown in spending,\u201d says Jeff Galak, associate professor of marketing at Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Tepper School of Business. Signs include record-high consumer credit card debt \u2014 balances reached over $1 trillion in the second quarter of 2023, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York \u2014 a reduced personal savings rate and the increased cost of goods due to inflation, Galak says.Consumers are feeling the pinch. Some 2023 shoppers say they plan to purchase gifts for fewer people this holiday season (31%) or spend less on gifts per person (30%) compared with past years, according to the 2023 Holiday Shopping Report from NerdWallet.Retailers are facing pressures too, which likely means smaller markdowns for Black Friday, Galak says. \u201cTheir supply chains are also pushing prices higher, so it\u2019s not like there\u2019s an infinite amount that they can discount whatever the latest television is. There\u2019s still a floor, and that floor is going up.\u201dRelated: Spending like crazy? Struggling between paydays? Consumers are sending mixed signals ahead of the holidaysWhile Black Friday prices probably won\u2019t reach all-time lows, shoppers will find deals galore. In fact, many retailers have been in holiday sales mode since the beginning of October. Among the early entries: Walmart Deals Holiday Kickoff, which ran from Oct. 9 through 12, and Amazon\u2019s Prime Big Deal Days on Oct. 10 and 11.These events preview the products and discounts shoppers might find during Black Friday sales. For example, Amazon AMZN, -0.57% and Walmart WMT, -8.36% discounted Apple AAPL, +0.69% Airpods Pro (2nd generation) from $249 to $189, the lowest price so far this year.Retailers bring out some of their best sales when they know customers are most prone to shop. Black Friday remained the most popular shopping day of Thanksgiving weekend in 2022, notes Katherine Cullen, vice president of industry and consumer insights at the National Retail Federation. \u201cIt does seem that even with the early start to the shopping season, consumers do still very much look to Thanksgiving weekend for a sense of tradition,\u201d she says.Expect additional chances to save money as holiday deals continue past November. But if you spot a price that suits your budget, it may be worth buying early.Check out: Do you know your credit card\u2019s interest rate? Here\u2019s how much a few percentage points can cost you over time.Lingering effects from a weekslong autoworkers strike could create shipping delays for holiday shoppers and retailers, as could a federal government shutdown.Logistical problems stemming from the United Auto Workers strike could cause delivery issues if trucks can\u2019t get parts needed for repairs, says Rob Handfield, a professor of supply chain management at North Carolina State University\u2019s Poole College of Management.The U.S. government narrowly escaped a shutdown in September, but funding lasts only through Nov. 17 \u2014 one week before Black Friday.\u201cWe rely on a lot of government services to make supply chains work: Customs and Border [Protection], a lot of the regulatory agencies, the FAA,\u201d Handfield says. \u201cIf there\u2019s a government shutdown and some of those agencies are impacted, it\u2019s going to impact import/exports, it could impact our rail system, it could impact our transportation system.\u201dStill, experts don\u2019t expect the same level of supply chain disruptions as in the past couple of years.Retailers have taken steps to diversify their supply chains and work around external shocks, Cullen says. \u201cOftentimes, they\u2019ve moved up the lead times for holiday inventory for key events. Also, a longer shopping season gives more runway for consumers to come back and find items that may have been in short stock early in the season.\u201dCullen adds that retailers have been increasingly transparent about what\u2019s in stock, where it\u2019s available and how long deliveries might take, which can help shoppers decide what to buy and when.Plus: Buy now, pay later for holiday travel is on the rise: Should you use it?Black Friday shoppers may get accommodations when it comes to making returns.Many major retailers relax return policies or extend return windows around the holidays. Walmart, which normally has a 90-day return limit, will allow most purchases made from Oct. 1, 2023, to Dec. 31, 2023, to be returned through Jan. 31, 2024. Target TGT, -0.79% won\u2019t start its 30-day return clock until Dec. 26 for electronics and entertainment items purchased from Oct. 1 to Dec. 24.Some consumers can even get a refund without leaving their cars or their homes.Target rolled out free drive-up returns in time for holiday shopping. The service lets shoppers initiate a return in the app and complete the transaction in the store\u2019s parking lot.See: Small-business retailers: How to make gift cards your ticket to success this holiday seasonUber UBER, +0.33% also recently launched a \u201cReturn a Package\u201d feature allowing people to send up to five packages via courier to a local post office, UPS UPS, -0.78% or FedEx FDX, -2.02% location for a $5 maximum fee.Read return policy and service details before you shop Black Friday sales to better understand your options.More From NerdWalletLauren Schwahn writes for NerdWallet.

            "title": "PCs and cars are the future for this giant but little-known chip-designer",
            "description": "Growth opportunities for Arm Holdings  look strong despite stiff headwinds.\u201cAt the heart of every smartphone today is a chip based on Arm technology, including those from Apple and Samsung.\u201d One of the world\u2019s most important technology companies is also one of the least discussed. Arm Holdings ARM, -2.74% is a U.K.-based company founded in 1990 that has been the silent leader in the expansion of computing outside the world of servers and PCs. If you have a smartphone, a connected appliance, a smart TV, or digital home assistant, your personal technology has Arm at its core. Arm has an interesting business history. It was purchased by the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank Group 9984, +1.48% in 2016, had an acquisition attempt in 2020 from Nvidia NVDA, +0.44% that failed regulatory hurdles, and finally went back to being a publicly traded company on Nasdaq last Septmber. Arm just announced its first quarterly earnings report after its IPO, with the market generally pleased with the past three months of revenue but wary of the guidance given for the next quarter. In my view, there are good reasons to believe that Arm has great years ahead of it with expansion into new markets and new revenue streams, but also a few headwinds that put long-term growth at risk.Arm is most often associated with the explosion of the smartphone market, and for good reason. With few exceptions, at the heart of every smartphone today is a chip based on Arm technology, including those from Apple AAPL, +0.69% and Samsung 005930, +0.83%. While the handset space has been problematic for companies recently with the softness of sales in China, indications are that the region is picking back up, with a note from Qualcomm QCOM, -0.19% in its latest earnings to underscore that point. A reinvigorated smartphone market, with the help of on-device AI adoption, will improve the outlook where the company\u2019s largest revenue stream is tied. There are many areas of growth for Arm outside of the smartphone market. The PC space is getting active, as Qualcomm announced a new Snapdragon processor last month that\u2019s meant to displace Intel INTC, +6.06% and AMD AMD, +1.69%. Qualcomm\u2019s new Oryon core powering the chip is based on Arm architecture. And recent rumors of Nvidia and AMD entering into the Windows-on-Arm chip market gives Arm yet another avenue. As the automotive market becomes more about computing and assisted driving, Arm-based products are going to be at the heart of that transition. Qualcomm is one of the leaders in this space as well, mostly utilizing Arm technology. But other Arm partners including NXP Semiconductors NXPI, +0.05%, Renesas Electronics 6723, +4.77% and Cadence Design Systems CDNS, +1.06% are involved in the rollout of automotive technologies from advanced driver-assistance systems to digital cockpits, and all are integrating Arm processors of some kind. This segment is expected to grow at close to a 10% CAGR for at least the next five years and offers a significant revenue opportunity. \u201cMore than 7.1 billion devices shipped this past quarter with Arm technology inside them.\u201d Crucially, Arm has also made progress in the data center segment with its Neoverse family of IP that is targeted at powering cloud- and edge server infrastructure. As more data centers look to find ways to improve or maintain performance while lowering fixed costs of power and space, the advantages that Arm CPUs have in efficiency and scalability shine. And while the data center segment has a been a target for Arm since before the AI revolution, its significant partnership with Nvidia, the clear leader in the enterprise AI race, means that Arm-based products like the Nvidia Grace CPU will drive revenue and relevancy. Read: Big tech is battling to put AI on your PC, laptop and smartphoneIn its most recent earnings report, Arm said that more than 7.1 billion devices had shipped this past quarter with Arm technology inside them. That\u2019s a stunning number and one that tells you how deeply embedded and how pervasive the Arm architecture is in our connected world. We aren\u2019t just talking about companies like Apple, Qualcomm, and Samsung, but also Toshiba 6502, -0.02%, NXP, and Tata Communications 500483, +1.35%. Even Intel and AMD are utilizing Arm designs for some portion of their product lines. Moreover, Arm CEO Rene Haas mentioned in a recent interview with CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer that the strong increase in licensing revenue that Arm saw in this quarter\u2019s earnings report is a \u201cstrong indicator for R&D investment.\u201d This is good news for Arm \u2014 the more product development that is happening today on its IP means that future products released to market will be based on that R&D work, cycling back to more revenue and market share for Arm.Perhaps the biggest risk to Arm is competition. Not from the world of x86 processors that are trying to not be displaced by Arm designs, but by another low power architecture. RISC-V (pronounced \u201crisk five\u201d) is a competing instruction set architecture (ISA). That basically means it is based on a different set of computer microinstructions, not compatible with either Arm or x86 designs. RISC-V is an \u201copen\u201d design, meaning that, at least in theory, it is free to utilize for both academic and commercial use cases. This is obviously an advantage over the Arm architecture, where companies must pay a licensing or royalty fee to design their own Arm CPU or to use one of the cores designed by Arm itself. This openness also means that companies and the RISC-V community are encouraged to share best practices for designs, improving performance and time-to-market. Many tech companies are already using RISC-V for some of their platforms. For example, Qualcomm\u2019s Lu Dai sits on the RISC-V board, as does Nvidia\u2019s Frans Sijstermans. Qualcomm announced a RISC-V based wearable platform, and Alphabet\u2019s Google GOOGL, +1.65% announced OS support for it.How big is this existential risk to Arm? The truth is that migrating or building a RISC-V core is a very heavy engineering lift. Though I don\u2019t have specifics on pricing, if a customer is going to license a core based on RISC-V from a company like SiFive, one of the primary advantages over Arm (cost) seems to fall away. Arm should take this risk to its business model seriously, and it appears to be doing so. There have been shifts in programs offered by the company including a \u201cflexible access\u201d model that offers no-cost access to Arm IP for companies that are in the startup stage, clearly targeting many potential customers of the RISC-V ecosystem.The other big risk for Arm is finding a way to get credit and recognition for its value in the tech space. Much better-known companies such as Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm themselves struggle to maintain brand recognition and brand value as a component company in the products and services that people use every day. Qualcomm makes the modem in almost every flagship smartphone today, and Intel powers 75%+ of the laptops sold each year, but few consumers recognize that fact or even care. Arm is even one more step removed from that; its designs, for example, power the Snapdragon processors that enable flagship Samsung handsets. Getting credit for that enabling work, from the investor market as well as the consumer (and to some degree a share of wallet) is a difficult task. These headwinds aside, the next five years and beyond for Arm look strong. It\u2019s leadership in the smartphone market likely will not be challenged and the areas of growth, from PCs to AI to cars, offer significant revenue upside.

            "title": "Hedge funds are betting that stocks will fall and indexes will rise at the same time. What\u2019s going on?",
            "description": "There's an issue that's been bugging stock-market investors all year.The latest report from Goldman Sachs Group\u2019s prime brokerage, which facilitates trading for many of the world\u2019s largest and most prestigious buy-side firms, cut right to the heart of an issue that has been troubling Wall Street professionals all year. That is, strong performance in indexes like the S&P 500 SPX and Nasdaq Composite COMP belie weakness in most U.S.-traded stocks. While the latest prime-brokerage data shared by the investment bank showed sophisticated investors had upped their bets against individual stocks, this same cohort also increased its long positions in equity indexes and index-tracking products, many of which aim to replicate the performance of the S&P 500 and other popular indexes.Hedge funds have now added to short positions against individual stocks for 14 weeks, a notable stretch. But at the same time, these sophisticated and extremely active trading firms have been piling into bullish bets on U.S. stock-market indexes over the past three weeks. At first brush, this might not make a whole lot of sense, until one considers the following: Because the S&P 500 is now so heavily weighted toward megacap technology stocks, a bet on the index is tantamount to a bet that the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d \u2014 a group of megacap technology stocks responsible for most of the market\u2019s gains this year \u2014 will continue to drive it higher. Most Wall Street analysts consider the group\u2019s membership to include shares of Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.69%, Alphabet Inc. GOOG, +1.62%, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +1.57%, Nvidia Corp. NVDA, +0.43%, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -0.57%, Tesla Inc. TSLA, -4.28% and Meta Platforms Inc. META, +0.09%. Meanwhile, selling pressure on individual stocks, particularly energy and financial names, has only intensified. Earlier this month, it looked as if the rally in stocks might finally be broadening out as most corners of the market rose in tandem. All three major U.S. equity indexes, the S&P 500 SPX, Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA and Nasdaq Composite COMP, logged their best week of the year during the week ended Nov. 3 as breadth made a brief but surprising comeback. Perhaps most notably, the Russell 2000 RUT, a popular index of small-cap stocks, gained more than 7% that week, outperforming the broader market and posting its best week in two years, FactSet data show. Instances of small-caps outperforming the Nasdaq this year have been pretty uncommon. Gains in all 11 S&P 500 sectors spurred hopes that the 2023 rally might finally be broadening out. But these hopes had seemingly fizzled by Friday\u2019s close. During a phone interview with MarketWatch, Mark Newton, global head of technical strategy at Fundstrat Global Advisors, said the share of S&P 500 companies trading north of their 200-day moving average \u2014 a closely watched indicator of market breadth used by technical analysts \u2014 finished last week at around one-third, well off its highs from earlier in the year. While weak breadth doesn\u2019t necessarily guarantee that the major indexes are destined to erase their gains from the past three weeks, Newton and others believe it could be difficult for stocks to move much higher from here unless more stocks and sectors join in. Most of the S&P 500\u2019s 11 sectors are trading in the red year-to-date, while the top performers like information technology and communication services have seen double-digit gains. \u201cYou\u2019re not seeing a substantial movement off the lows in a broad-based fashion,\u201d Newton said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean the market has to fall back, but it does mean the broader market needs to start participating soon.\u201d Newton isn\u2019t the only one keeping a close eye on breadth. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty focused on that,\u201d said Greg Bassuk, chief executive officer of AXS Investments, during an interview with MarketWatch. Bassuk said he expects strong earnings and hopes tied to the artificial-intelligence boom will continue to drive these stocks higher in the coming months. The company cut its guidance for the current quarter and its full fiscal year.Joseph Adinolfi is a markets reporter at MarketWatch. Joseph Adinolfi is a markets reporter at MarketWatch.

            "title": "Berkshire Hathaway: Time To Be Greedy",
            "description": "Berkshire Hathaway reported robust Q3 earnings, driven by impressive performance in the insurance sector. Click here to read what is in store for the future.Mark Wilson Mark WilsonAfter Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A)(NYSE:BRK.B) released its successful earnings results for Q3 earlier this month, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s safe to say that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing not to like about Warren Buffett\u00e2\u0080\u0099s firm at this stage. Despite trading close to its all-time high levels, Berkshire Hathaway shares offer a decent upside in the current environment full of geopolitical and macroeconomic risks. The company trades at multiples that are lower in comparison to the market average and it has more than enough growth opportunities along with the sizable war chest to create additional shareholder value in the following years. As such, I believe that it makes sense to stick with my BUY rating for Berkshire Hathaway for now.Earlier this month Berkshire Hathaway reported impressive earnings results for Q3 which showed that the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operating earnings increased by 41% Y/Y to $10.76 billion. At the same time, the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s portfolio remains robust and there are reasons to believe that Berkshire Hathaway has more than enough opportunities to continue to generate such returns even in the current environment.If we look at the insurance business results, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see that the investment income of its insurance portfolio in Q3 stood at $2.47 billion in comparison to $1.41 billion a year ago, while the underwriting earnings were $2.42 billion against a loss of $1.07 billion a year ago. Such a great performance was mostly a result of an elevated catastrophe activity, which was not the case a year ago, as the net premium change this year has been minimal. Going forward, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s likely that Berkshire Hathaway\u00e2\u0080\u0099s insurance business will continue to generate solid returns, as the industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ROE is expected to stand at 9.5% next year, above the estimated ROE of 6.5% this year.What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more, is that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing not to like about Berkshire Hathaway\u00e2\u0080\u0099s public investment portfolio as well. Although the company recorded $23.5 billion in unrealized investment losses mostly due to the decline of the overall market in September, the market is currently recovering from its lows, it has already pared the losses from last month, and it could appreciate further due to the strong performance of the American economy. As such, Berkshire Hathaway\u00e2\u0080\u0099s public investments could increase in value as well in the foreseeable future since the shares of Apple (AAPL), which is the biggest public position of Warren Buffett\u00e2\u0080\u0099s firm, have already appreciated by over 10% from its late-October lows. If this trend continues, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a possibility that unrealized losses could become unrealized gains in a matter of months. At the same time, nothing is stopping Berkshire Hathaway from holding those positions for a long time until they generate significant gains given the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s record liquidity. After all, most of Berkshire Hathaway\u00e2\u0080\u0099s public holdings are mostly established firms with predictable income streams that are more than likely to generate solid returns in the long run.Considering all of this, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s safe to say that Berkshire Hathaway is a solid business to own in the current environment full of macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges. While the shares have slightly depreciated since the publication of my latest article in September, there are reasons to believe that now they offer an even better point of entry.Currently, Berkshire Hathaway trades at less than 20 times its forward earnings and only at ~2 times its forward sales. For comparison, the average S&P 500 forward P/E ratio is ~24x, which indicates that Berkshire Hathaway is undervalued in comparison to the rest of the market.What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more, is that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also safe to say that those investors who want to hold a stake in Apple should do so by purchasing Berkshire Hathaway shares instead. Not only will Berkshire Hathaway benefit from all of the growth opportunities that Apple offers regardless due its sizable stake in the business, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also able to offer additional safety to investors thanks to its exposure to assets from different industries. At the current price, Apple is already overvalued in comparison to the market and Berkshire Hathaway, and what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more, is that its shares have also underperformed against the firm of Warren Buffett in the last six months.Add to all of this the fact that Berkshire Hathaway has $157.2 billion in cash reserves that could be used at any moment to gain stakes in lucrative businesses and it becomes obvious that Warren Buffett\u00e2\u0080\u0099s firm is a no-brainer investment in the current environment. Seeking Alpha\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quant system also thinks that Berkshire Hathaway is a strong buy, while the consensus on the street is that the shares represent a ~16% upside at the current price. As such, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sticking with my BUY rating as there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing not to like about Berkshire Hathaway at this stage.Berkshire Hathaway's Consensus Price Target (Seeking Alpha)Berkshire Hathaway's Consensus Price Target (Seeking Alpha)Despite the upside that Berkshire Hathaway offers, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still important to understand that some macro risks are outside of the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s control, which could negatively affect the performance of its shares in the short to near term.First of all, while the U.S. economy is likely to keep the momentum going into Q4 after the impressive performance in Q3, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a risk that if the Federal Reserve sticks with its hawkish policy for a while and keeps rates higher for longer \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the economy could enter a recession and take the whole market down with it. This could result in a depreciation of Berkshire Hathaway\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shares as well. After all, the pace of buybacks has already slowed down in Q3 in comparison to Q2, which could indicate that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a risk that Berkshire Hathaway\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stock goes lower first before going higher later.Despite all the risks discussed above, Berkshire Hathaway remains an attractive investment at the current levels as its shares are undervalued in comparison to the rest of the market. At the same time, the business itself is well positioned to face all the macro and geopolitical risks and continue to create additional shareholder value for years to come thanks to the sizable war chest and a number of growth opportunities from which Berkshire Hathaway should be able to easily benefit.The world is in disarray and it's time to build a portfolio that will weather all the systemic shocks that will come your way.

            "description": "What Morgan Stanley likes for 2024 are high-quality stocks and bonds.The big news over the weekend for financial markets was, of course, MarketWatch 50 member and one-woman economic tailwind Taylor Swift leaping into the arms of Travis Kelce, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end, after a concert in Argentina. The investment implications:Okay, now that you\u2019ve spit out your coffee, onto the real call of the day. It\u2019s the time of the year where investment banks produce their year-ahead outlooks, and both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley took to the printing press with their forecasts that admittedly don\u2019t have a strong chance of actually happening, but provide a filter through which to discuss the pros and cons of different investment choices.The global equities team at Goldman Sachs on Monday put out a note saying markets will still be stuck in a \u201cfat and flat\u201d range \u2014 that is, there may be fairly large swings in equity markets, the fat part, but not a whole lot of actual progress, i.e., flat.Perhaps more notable are the signs of optimism coming from Morgan Stanley. The team lifted its S&P 500 SPX target to 4,500 for the end of 2024 from 4,200 (although the latter number only extended to June 2024).The end of rate hikes, and the beginning of rate cuts, means that high-grade bonds will outperform, the dollar DXY will stay strong and emerging markets will lag, they say.Granted, the team aren\u2019t exactly ecstatic. \u201cFinancial conditions are tight. Rate cuts generally aren\u2019t expected until later in 2024. Downside risks to global growth are high. An earnings recession is still in train. Bond supply continues to be a market concern. EM fundamentals face headwinds. Cross-asset correlations have not budged from extremes. Finesse will be needed to find openings in markets which can generate positive returns,\u201d the team say.They\u2019re expecting cuts from both the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank in June next year, and they\u2019re also expecting China to find its footing.What will work? \u201c2024 will once again be a good year for income investing. Even if rates don\u2019t fall as much as we expect, for yield-focused investors U.S. core bonds at 6%+ yields are the most attractive since 2009. Valuations for high-quality fixed income look attractive outright,\u201d they say.As for stocks, they (and Goldman, incidentally) love Japan. \u201cFor Japanese stocks, we\u2019ve long argued that the market is supported by secular factors, lifting [return on equities] to converge with global stocks. This is playing out. The region is also more insulated from downside risks to Asia growth and geopolitical risks,\u201d they say.They also recommend a barbell approach of defensive growth and late-cycle cyclicals, citing data showing average returns of 8% when the Conference Board\u2019s leading economic index contracts from peaks of at least 3%, outside of recession. \u201cThis is historically a supportive performance backdrop for (1) traditional defensives (healthcare, staples and utilities), (2) select growth opportunities (lower volatility growth, in particular, along with stocks levered to secular themes that can outweigh cyclical risks), and (3) late cycle cyclicals (industrials and energy.)\u201dAmong their traditional defensive picks: Costco COST, -3.18%, US Foods USFD, -1.00%, Walmart WMT, -8.36%, Keurig Dr Pepper KDP, -0.28% and Philip Morris International PM, -0.78%. More defensive/lower volatility growth stocks that are overweight include Nike NKE, -0.51%, McDonald\u2019s MCD, +1.74%, Hilton HLT, +0.64%, Marriott MAR, +1.01% and Yum Brands YUM, +0.69%. Late-cycle cyclicals include Northrop Grumman NOC, -0.31%, ConocoPhillips COP, -3.37%, Marathon Oil MRO, -2.97% and Delta Airlines DAL, -1.19%. U.S. stock futures ES00, -0.16% NQ00, -0.17% were perched a slight bit lower ahead of CPI data on Tuesday. Bitcoin BTCUSD, -5.46% was weaker, having surged 39% over the last month.For more market updates plus actionable trade ideas for stocks, options and crypto, subscribe to MarketDiem by Investor\u2019s Business Daily.Moody\u2019s late Friday lowered the outlook on the U.S. credit rating to negative ahead of what could be another government shutdown, though the main reason cited was rising interest rates and the lack of fiscal measures to offset them.

Learn MoreWarren Buffett is arguably one of the best investors of all time. He's created fortunes for Berkshire Hathaway shareholders during the more than five decades he's overseen the conglomerate's investments. And he continues to find new ways to grow his fellow shareowners' wealth.Unsurprisingly, investors pay close attention to the moves Buffett and his team make in Berkshire's massive $345 billion stock portfolio. Here are two of Buffett's biggest bets in the stock market -- both of which are still attractive buys today.Geopolitical turmoil in the Middle East and Europe makes clear the crucial need for reliable sources of affordable energy. CEO Vicki Hollub is positioning Occidental Petroleum (OXY -2.15%) to help meet the global demand for dependable energy -- specifically, in the form of oil and natural gas -- for decades to come.Many analysts believe that constrained supply resulting from the overall energy industry's underinvestment in new projects and infrastructure, combined with rising demand from developing economies, could drive oil prices higher in the coming years. Occidental derives a larger percentage of its revenue from oil production operations than many of its peers, so it's poised to profit handsomely from these trends.Yet Occidental is far more than just an oil driller. This Buffett favorite is also a leader in the exciting field of carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS).In August, Occidental struck a deal to acquire Carbon Engineering, a pioneer in direct air capture (DAC) technology that removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The $1.1 billion purchase should allow Occidental to accelerate its plans to create a network of up to 1,000 DAC facilities in the U.S. and international markets in the coming decades. Occidental expects its Stratos facility to be capable of capturing 500,000 tons of carbon dioxide annually after it comes online in mid-2025.Demand for carbon capture solutions is projected to grow rapidly as more businesses and governments strive to achieve their net-zero emissions goals. For its part, ExxonMobil estimates that the carbon capture market could soar to a stunning $4 trillion by 2050. Hollub, in turn, expects Occidental to eventually make more money from its carbon management business than it does from its oil and gas operations today.Notably, Buffett has been adding to Berkshire's stake in this innovative energy provider. Following his recent buys, Berkshire Hathaway owns more than a quarter of Occidental's shares, a massive stake valued at roughly $14 billion.Like Occidental, Apple (AAPL 0.77%) is set to benefit from powerful long-term trends. With high-speed connectivity and seamless mobility likely to only grow in importance, the iPhone maker's unrivaled profitability is set to become even more impressive.More than 2 billion Apple devices are in use around the world. In addition to the massive profits the tech giant earns from the sale of these devices, Apple also generates a fast-growing stream of recurring revenue. With over 1 billion paid subscriptions, Apple's booming services business already produces $85 billion in annual sales -- a figure that appears set to head even higher.Apple is raising prices on several of its popular services, including Apple TV+, Arcade, News+, and its bundled offering, Apple One. The price hikes should bolster the company's revenue and profits from this already high-margin segment.Additionally, Apple recently unveiled its new line of M3 processors. The faster, more efficient chips are expected to boost sales of iMac desktop computers and MacBook Pro laptops. Higher Mac sales would help to further expand Apple's thriving device and services ecosystem.These growth catalysts should help to propel Apple's nearly $100 billion in annual profits to new heights in the years ahead. Buffett is certainly bullish on the tech titan's prospects. Apple is Berkshire Hathaway's largest holding by far. Buffett's company has amassed a staggering $167 billion stake in Apple's stock.Joe Tenebruso has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Learn MoreExchange-traded funds (ETFs) can be a fantastic choice for those looking for a low-effort investment that could help you make a lot of money over time. But with countless ETFs to choose from, it can be tough to decide where to invest.S&P 500 ETFs track the S&P 500 index itself, so each fund includes stocks from 500 of the largest and strongest companies in the U.S. These companies range from tech behemoths like Apple and Amazon to century-old brands like Procter & Gamble and 3M.While S&P 500 ETFs have plenty of perks, they're not the right investment for everyone. Here are three reasons you may want to buy this type of ETF, and one good reason to avoid it.Image source: Getty Images.As with all ETFs, the stocks within the fund are chosen for you -- which can help take the guesswork out of investing. You don't need to research individual companies or keep up with industry trends. Simply invest whatever you can afford each month, and the fund will do the rest.This ETF can be a smart option, then, for those looking for a \"set it and forget it\" type of investment. Whether you're new to the stock market or simply want an investment that requires next to no effort on your part, the S&P 500 ETF could be a good fit for your portfolio.Because each ETF contains stocks from 500 companies, this creates instant diversification and can limit your risk.The hundreds of stocks within each S&P 500 ETF are also from a wide variety of industries, ranging from tech to healthcare to utilities to financials and more. In general, the more diverse your portfolio is, the lower your risk. Even if an entire industry takes a hit during a market downturn, your investment is more likely to survive when it's well diversified.There are never any guarantees when investing. However, investing in an S&P 500 ETF is about as close to guaranteed long-term returns as you can get in the stock market.The S&P 500 itself has a decades-long history of recovering from even the worst downturns. In fact, analysts at Crestmont Research examined the index's rolling 20-year total returns and found that in every single 20-year period, the S&P 500 earned positive total returns. In other words, if you had invested in an S&P 500 ETF at any point in history and held it for 20 years, you'd have made money.Over the last two decades alone, the S&P 500 has experienced remarkable returns -- despite facing some of the worst recessions and market crashes in history in those years.^SPX data by YChartsSince 2000, it's experienced everything from the dot-com bubble burst to the Great Recession to the COVID-19 crash to the most recent slump. Yet it's still up by more than 200% in that timeframe.S&P 500 ETFs come with a slew of advantages, but there's one major drawback: They can only earn average returns. This type of investment is designed to follow the market, so it's impossible for it to beat the market.To decide whether this is a dealbreaker for you, consider your investing goals. If you're looking primarily for a low-maintenance investment that can limit your risk while still helping you make money over time, the S&P 500 ETF is still a good choice -- despite its lower returns.On the other hand, if you're willing to put more time and effort into your strategy, investing in individual stocks may be a better option. This approach does require more research (and can carry more risk), but if done well, you could potentially beat the market substantially. Over the long haul, that could result in earning tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars more.There's no single correct way to invest, so the right investment for you will depend on your goals and priorities. If you're looking for a simpler and safer investment that can help build wealth over time, the S&P 500 ETF may be a fantastic fit for your portfolio. But if you're looking to maximize your earnings, individual stocks may be the better option for you.John Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

            "title": "These tech stocks scored this earnings season even as AI hype slowed -- and the winner may surprise you",
            "description": "Microsoft proves its strength; Qualcomm may have turned a corner.The hype around artificial intelligence was taken down a notch in the third quarter, as Big Tech companies came under pressure to show results in what has become the largest technological shift since the creation of the internet. The upshot of last quarter\u2019s earnings reports was that there\u2019s steady and significant spending on AI, even as there are signs the U.S. economy is slowing amid high interest rates. Companies with the most exposure to AI are catching a tailwind that I expect will last for years, perhaps even for well over a decade.Microsoft MSFT, +1.56% proved it\u2019s the strongest of the group, with better-than-expected revenue, higher margins and a reacceleration in its Azure cloud unit. On the other side of the spectrum, a beleaguered Qualcomm QCOM, -0.21% emerged from a difficult year and raised its guidance, suggesting the maker of chips for handsets and PCs has turned the corner. AI stories are everywhere, especially at semiconductor companies that are powering this new computing revolution. But a good read on the adoption of the technology can be seen in less visible companies, including IBM IBM, -0.02% and ServiceNow NOW, +0.02%. Both are gaining momentum, ensuring ever-stronger competition in Big Tech. \u201cMicrosoft is the biggest company investor in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT.\u201d Here\u2019s my Big Tech review for the companies above as well as for Meta Platforms META, +0.10%, Amazon.com AMZN AMZN, -0.58%, Intel INTC, +6.00% and Apple AAPL, +0.69%. Microsoft: Microsoft is the clear frontrunner in AI-focused Big Tech, driven by its strong monetization and adoption narrative. In the third quarter, it showcased robust results across many metrics, and strong performance was fueled by AI and cloud services. Microsoft is the biggest company investor in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT.Total revenue rose 13% to $56.5 billion from a year earlier, almost $2 billion more than expected by analysts. Azure, Microsoft\u2019s enterprise cloud unit, posted an acceleration in revenue growth, to 29%, compared with 26% in the previous quarter, allaying concerns companies are moderating spending. Microsoft, despite its $2.6 trillion market value, is still growing quickly for a company this big. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s getting more profitable. Gross margins widened to 71%, up 2 percentage points. And operating margins jumped by 5 percentage points to 48%. Qualcomm: The chip designer exceeded expectations in the third quarter and raised its guidance, indicating momentum in China and strength in most sectors except internet of things (IoT). The new forecast is for revenue of as high as $9.9 billion in the current quarter. In a recent conversation with CEO Cristiano Amon, he expressed confidence in Qualcomm\u2019s strength, highlighting positive revenue growth from Chinese manufacturers and significant growth in the automotive business. He said smartphone makers have worked through most of their inventory and are starting to place orders again. Boosting investor confidence, Qualcomm signed a new supply agreement with Apple in September.While Amon is cautious, the overall sentiment surrounding Qualcomm is brightening, with Qualcomm entering recovery mode. This is one to watch.Read: Qualcomm\u2019s newest laptop chips hit Intel, AMD and Apple with a powerful punchIBM: IBM, steady under CEO Arvind Krishna, posted revenue of $14.75 billion in the third quarter, up 4.6% and beating estimates. The company\u2019s focus on AI was evident, with notable software and consulting wins. Revenue in the software segment, which includes AI, rose 7.8% to $6.3 billion. Customers are increasingly opting for the Watson X AI platform, the CEO said on a conference call with analysts. The company also confirmed its previous full-year guidance for revenue and cash flow growth. Speaking with CFO Jim Kavanaugh, it was evident that the overall, IBM performance was marked by operational efficiency and margin expansion, but also confidence that the company\u2019s AI and hybrid cloud strategies are meeting the company\u2019s revenue and margin expectations, indicating the company\u2019s strategic approach in navigating the evolving tech landscape is working. ServiceNow: ServiceNow showcased consistent growth in simplifying complex software environments with its AI-powered Now platform. The company is operating at a $10 billion annual rate, a milestone, having posted accelerating revenue growth for the third straight quarter. I spoke to CEO Bill McDermott on earnings day. Beyond the results, he emphasized efficiency gains, significant customer wins and a positive reception for the company\u2019s Vancouver platform, which embeds generative AI across all workflows. McDermott said in an interview with MarketWatch\u2019s sister publication Barron\u2019s that he expects increases in spending on IT to double to 7% as companies fear being left behind. They will make cuts elsewhere to pay for AI software, he said.Meta Platforms: Meta is spending heavily on AI and mixed reality. CFO Susan Li said in the third-quarter report that she expects operating losses to rise meaningfully at Reality Labs, a research unit that works on AI, machine learning, neural control interface and full body tracking. On the bright side, the number of daily and monthly active users in various categories all rose during the quarter, by up to 7%. Advertising revenue jumped 24% to $33.6 billion, more than twice the pace of rival Alphabet GOOG, +1.61%. Amazon\u2019s ad revenue increased slightly faster, by 26%, though the total amount in dollar terms is almost one-third that of Meta. Meta\u2019s investments in AI are aimed at giving retailers improved targeted ads. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said increases in time spent on Facebook and Instagram are a result of \u201cour recommendation improvements.\u201d Amazon: Amazon delivered a mixed performance in the third quarter. Revenue at the closely watched AWS cloud unit climbed 12%, slightly below expectations. In contrast, growth at Microsoft\u2019s competing business, Azure, was 29%, and it was 22% at Google Cloud. Still, AWS is materially larger than its chief rivals.A closely watched gauge at Amazon is profit margins, which widened for the third consecutive quarter as CEO Andy Jassy\u2019s austerity program pays off. Operating margins came in at 7.8%, the highest in more than two years. They had fallen to as low as 1.8% in the fourth quarter of 2022. Jassy cited AWS\u2019s innovation in generative AI, emphasizing momentum with notable clients including Adidas, Booking.com and Merck.Intel: Intel exhibited overall strength in the third quarter, surpassing expectations despite tough macro conditions and competition from chip powerhouse Nvidia NVDA, +0.43% (Nvidia is slated to release quarterly earnings on Nov. 21.) and AMD AMD, +1.65%, which recently forecasted a mega data-center AI number despite coming out with conservative guidance, which led to a mixed market response. While year-over-year growth in core businesses didn\u2019t meet ideal levels, Intel demonstrated improvement and CEO Pat Gelsinger expressed optimism about the company\u2019s progress. Intel\u2019s focus on AI-powered PCs and datacenter AI, coupled with outsized growth in the foundry segment, positions the company well for future opportunities. Still, datacenter AI needs to produce faster growth. In a conversation I had with Gelsinger, we discussed the critical importance of the AI opportunity and I sense he sees a tangible opportunity that should materialize for Intel as AI shifts to inference, where CPUs and accelerators will be more prevalent, playing to Intel\u2019s strengths. Let\u2019s say this: Intel still has some work to do.Apple: The headlines on Apple earnings are dominated by the fact that the company has posted four straight quarterly declines in revenue. That, no doubt, is important. Having said that, Apple could teach master classes in managing its sprawling operations. Operating margins climbed two percentage points to 30% in a slowing economy. Plus, revenue came in as expected, and earnings were better than expected. The new iPhone cycle hasn\u2019t been all that exciting, and the new M3 chip isn\u2019t as compelling as one thought it might be. And while declines in revenue may make some say this wasn\u2019t a good quarter, I\u2019ll argue that these results coupled with strong services growth \u2014 up 16% \u2014 makes for an overall decent report. We all knew the hardware party wouldn\u2019t last forever \u2014 this temporary downturn in devices is pushing Apple to innovate on services and drive-up margins, which will be good for the company and its investors long term.

Watch out for cannibals. You're listening to Motley Fool money. I'm Ricky Mulvey joined today by Jim Gillies. Jim, good to see you.Jim Gillies: It's good to be seen, Ricky.Ricky Mulvey: We're going to keep it a little later on Halloween. You just got back from Las Vegas, so you see anything weird out there?Jim Gillies: What wasn't weird out there? Vegas. This was my first time going to Vegas where I wasn't working. In the past, when I've gone to Vegas, it's been maximum 48 hours. Usually occasionally less than 24 fly in, go give a talk talk in a hotel conference room. Maybe they buy you dinner. Hopefully they buy you a cab back to the airport, you fly out. This is the first time I've actually gone and experienced Vegas. Yes, the whole the one thing that struck me was the sheer amount of raw naked capitalism flowing through that city. I was with my significant other who last time she was there was 23 years ago. She was commenting constantly how it has grown from then. She says, I thought it was pretty crazy then. My inner hard charging capitalist was very impressed by the price of everything and how everyone was willingly paying it out. If you are gauging the American economy for signs of recession, do not go to Vegas, as much as I like paying for $23 cocktails and $95 to $100 filet mignons. I am happy to have at least spent a few days out of the Grand Canyon and Hoover Dam, and I am now safely back home.Ricky Mulvey: Wait, you said you were impressed by the price of things. It's not like not cheap, very expensive? Yes.Jim Gillies: Extremely expensive. From what I understand, that's not usually the way it used to be. No, you went to Vegas and everything was super cheap. No, they have decided that making money from gaming, although of course, they've also changed the odds on some of their gaming stuff to favor them. There's no $10 blackjack on the strip anymore. It's $25 blackjack. Blackjack no longer, you know, getting a blackjack no longer pays a 50% premium. Now it pays a 20% premium. Pays six to five instead of three to two. But that's my that's what little gambling I do. I like to play blackjack a little bit but.Ricky Mulvey: You got to go to the downtown Vegas, They still got it a little bit, but let's talk about stocks. Let's talk about stocks because, it's the spookiest day of the year. It's Halloween. Let's find some cannibals. Companies like to reward their investors. They can pay out dividends, add some discipline, maybe some tax consequences. Or they can buy back shares a little bit less discipline, but significantly better tax consequences. If you've owned Apple for any period of time, you've probably benefited from share buybacks. If you've owned a legacy auto maker, you've experienced share buybacks, but you haven't necessarily benefited. To set the table, what are the signs of a share buyback plan going right? Because we're going to focus on, we got Jim Gillies here, so we're going to talk about a weird little company that you haven't heard of, [laughs] But what are the signs of some share buybacks going right?Jim Gillies: Well, I mean, you've already mentioned one. That would be Apple, although I'm going to give Apple a B for their share buyback program. Even though Apple, over the past nine years, I believe, has taken out about 30% of their starting share count. Another company you may have heard of, eBay, has taken out, I believe, about 55% of their shares from about a decade ago. But the reason I give those guys B's is because, they buy back in any environment. But they can afford to, because they've got massive cash generation. They've got super strong balance sheets and they can pay for these buybacks through their cash generation with really out touching their balance sheet. But they don't pay any attention really, to valuation. Apple buys their shares back at ten times operating profit. They buy it back at 25 times operating profit. I'm going to suggest to you humbly, one of those is a better deal. A company like a Medpace Holdings, which I know Ricky, you and I have talked about on this show. Before. Medpace was doing fantastic in 2022, their stock got beaten down. They basically said, hey, guess what? We're going to buy back stock. They bought back 14% that's one seventh. They bought 14% of their company back in two quarters. Exhausted all of the cash they generated for about four or five years, took it out and the CEO bought a whole whack of shares himself, over $150 million worth. That's a buyback program that's done really well because the most recent quarter of the Medpace just had they bought back zero because the valuation is no longer as compelling. I like that type of buyback much better. But, you know, so we'll give Medpace an A, We'll give eBay and Apple the B, maybe a B plus, you know, But you really want to see a company that can afford the buybacks by generating their own cash and have at least some semblance of a look at valuation. Those are the best.Ricky Mulvey: But the Medpace example, that's a little bit trickier in practice because generally management teams, if they get to pick their spots, they buy back shares when valuations are high, they have extra cash flow coming in. Not necessarily when valuation is low,.Jim Gillies: It's like you're setting me up for the next part.Ricky Mulvey: Well, then let's talk about let's talk about air cap. I was watching.Jim Gillies: No, I thought you wanted to talk about a bad buyback.Ricky Mulvey: Okay. Then let's talk about a bad buyback.Jim Gillies: This is a company so nice, they've done it twice. The company is called the Sleep Number company. The makers of the Sleep Number bid the company, formerly known as Select Comfort, and they have done this maneuver twice. The first time in the mid 2000 from about 2004 through to just looking up my numbers here, from about 2004 up to about 2006 into 2007, company is very cash flow positive, they have no debt. The stock is up and up and up. Peaked at about 27, $28, then as the economy starts going up, they make beds, right? You might have, you might have heard of something happening in 2007. In 2008, some sort of a credit crisis tied to housing. Surely sales of beds is not tied to housing. Well, surprise, surprise, they were. Economy rolls over. This company starts making less cash than they had been making. They decide, well, our shares are now cheap, so we're going to buy back our stock. They blew their entire cash hoard they'd built up over the four or five years prior. They blew entirely on buybacks.Jim Gillies: They then said, boy, our stock is still cheap. They took on a credit line, spent another 100 plus million on buying back their stock, and then the company went cash flow negative, and the credit crisis hit. Essentially, they would have been bankrupt aside from the fact that their lenders don't want the business, frankly. But the stock that had been close to $28 a couple of years earlier, bottomed in 2008, 2009 at $0.19. The stock started coming back. They had to sell equity to vulture financers basically to pay off their debt and have the company survive and they did. But they basically had bought shares back at $25-$30 and they sold it at 3 or $4 That is not good. That is a buyback plan done incredibly poorly. Naturally, of course, management here learned. Of course, they didn't. The stock meanders along, they started becoming one of the greatest buyback stories around the Sleep Number Company. Heading into COVID, they were just buying back and they really accelerated during COVID because of course everyone's trapped in their homes. Hey, we're not going out. Let's buy a new bed. The company again starts racking up the buybacks paying any price for a buyback. The stock at this point in time, I think it topped out around 160,150 ballpark. Now a lot of that is leveraged because the share count has shrunk so significantly from the previous go-round as they buy back, but they're buying back at any price.COVID ends, rolls over. They're not making as much cash flow anymore. We might be going into recession, Vegas observations aside. Their cash generation has really fallen off a cliff, but oh, and by the way they also decided to supercharge these buybacks that got the stock. They shrunk the share account significantly. They supercharge those by borrowing almost $0.5 billion which now they have to find the money and by the way, they're not generating cash anymore. Shame about that $0.5 billion dollar debt you have at short term debt at ever higher interest rates. The stock is gone from 150 ish, I believe it's now down to about $16,17 so almost a 90% drop. The company is overlaid again with $0.5 billion in debt. It's now $380 million market cap I think, and the cash generation has again disappeared. I don't know that this stock is done falling and it's just like OK, if we do this again remember, buybacks should be done when you are cash generative, significantly have a strong balance sheet, maybe avoid leverage fueled buybacks in most cases. If you are in a cyclical industry, perhaps don't buy back stock on the way at industry cyclical peaks.Ricky Mulvey: Now you want to talk about a company that has a lot of debt and is executing a ton of buybacks.Jim Gillies: Yes, I do because I am nothing, if not persistent.Ricky Mulvey: Contradictory.Jim Gillies: Exactly.Ricky Mulvey: AerCap, you were talking about this with Nick Sciple on the morning show yesterday for Motley Fool members. It's the largest aircraft leasing company. This is a company that takes out a lot of debt so they can buy planes, lease them out to different airlines, that kind of thing. CEO Aengus Kelly, which you pointed out was weird, basically told analysts that they're looking to take the company private at some point. It's about what is it, a $14 billion company ish and then they're going to take out, I think, two billion dollar worth of share pre-purchases just this year. How is this not the Sleep Number story?Jim Gillies: Square that circle, sure. First off, you've said that they are not only the largest commercial airline lessor in the world. They're also the largest commercial airline owner in the world. That's not really well known because airlines, especially post COVID. They don't really want to own their planes anymore. Those are expensive. AerCap, the reason this is different is because this is a lessor. Debt is raw material to a lessor. It's like flour to Panera Bread. Now, intelligent use of that debt, of course, is required, but Aengus Kelly and the folks at AerCap have a pretty good history. A lot of that debt can be tied to various planes and what have you plus they've also got really long term leases with practically everyone in the world in terms of the airline companies. That doesn't bother me, although I will point out, and a lot of their debt, or their debt got amplified a little bit in the last couple of years because they took out a distressed portfolio of leases from GE Capital. They first were using their very significant cash flows to bring down some debt to get their leverage ratio at a predetermined level, which they've done in the past before with previous acquisitions which they already told you they were going to do.They got to that level, then they start buying back their stock because again, there is a significant cash flow coming from leases because they lease to everybody. They make a lot of cash and they're able to buy back stock. A lot of the stock they bought back this year alone has actually been from GE. Because when they bought GE's Capital or GE Capital's portfolio of leases. They paid about half in cash, which was basically they took out debt to backstop the planes from the debt, handed that cash to GE who then paid off the debt that GE was carrying to backstop the planes. That's a bit of a shell maneuver, but OK, fine. They paid about a half in cash/debt backstopping the planes and the other half in AerCap shares. GE wanting to monetize those shares has been doing a series of secondary offerings, and every single time they do secondary offerings to sell those shares into the market, AerCap steps up and says, hey, we'll buy $500 million worth of shares. We'll buy it back from you at a slightly discount price, and so they're buying themselves back on the ship. This is another intelligently done. Once you realize that the structure of a leasing company is that debt is raw material, run your leverage ratio, the cash flows are long term and contractual.They also sell assets. They'll buy a new plane, they'll run it for 8-12 years, maybe that plane has got a 25-30 year lifespan. They're depreciating the asset all the way along, and they're selling the plane after 8-12 years to a secondary carrier or a secondary lessor. When they do that, well, look, they're actually booking gains on sale which means their prior earnings were understated because they have been aggressively depreciating the asset. They sell that, they book extra gains, the proceeds from those asset sales get washed into, again, new purchases of planes, but also into buybacks. It tend to be a virtuous circle and I would encourage anyone interested in the AerCap story to go back from about 2010, '11 to just before COVID see how the cash flows they generated during good times and how they paid off the prior example of the back about 2011. They bought the aircraft portfolio from AIG, and what they did there and it's the same playbook and you're right, Ricky. In that conversation on the conference call with CEO Aengus Kelly, the question was, hey, your valuation is really low, would you consider taking the company private? He basically said, if the valuation stays where it is, at some point we're being so aggressively buying back our shares. Some point is going to make sense. There's your marching order Fools, get that valuation multiple up, otherwise the company's going to go away.Ricky Mulvey: Generally, when I think about aircraft companies or airline companies, I think of low margin businesses with just changing migraine level headaches. I know leasing is different than operating a airline, but looking at some of the recent earnings for JetBlue and Delta Airlines. JetBlue's got engine problems, there's flying limits at major airports, you got waning domestic demand, higher oil prices is a problem. There's always something new where there's some macro problem going on. This is a lot of the customers, so what's so much better about leasing out planes and owning planes in the background than running an airline?Jim Gillies: Sure. Well, it's the lessors don't have any of those problems you've just described there. That's the problem for the airlines. The lessor buys the plane, leases it out, long term contractual cash flows, and just says have at it, and everything's insured and what have you. They don't have the operating costs for running these things. They don't have the oil and gas and the fuel volatility, we'll call it. They don't have those as an issue. What the lessors are, they're just asset providers. There's the concept of discretionary spending like maybe we can squeeze an extra row into the airline if we move the seats a half inch each, they'll on the way. Maybe we can up capacity and we can change the routes or change the elevate. There's various ways that you can lower your costs as an airline. Another way is actually having the most up to date aircraft, what AerCap strives to provide. But the one thing that airlines can't do without, it's built in. They need planes.Ricky Mulvey: Yes they do.Jim Gillies: Your choice is either lease or own. To own is expensive, and then what do you do with the asset and especially coming out of COVID when a lot of the financial structures of the airlines are strapped. It's just easier to lease. Again, here is AerCap.Ricky Mulvey: Jim Gillies as always.

I've found that it's generally a more positive and thoughtful place than major social media outlets. If you want to check this our, it's community.fool.com. Up next, Halloween theme continues. Allison and Bro have some financial horror stories they will share.Robert Brokamp: Our first story, the Naughty, Rob the Nice. We lock our doors at night to prevent the monsters from sneaking in. But that doesn't always save us from the creepy and the crawly, because sometimes the monster is already inside the house. Our first tale begins with Mary Ellen Nice, whose husband of 61 years died and left behind a substantial estate that she could rely on for the rest of her life. Her son Chip Nice became the executor of his father's estate and eventually moved in with Mary Ellen to take care of her as she gradually showed more and more signs of dementia. Now, in such cases a good son would take care of both his mother and her money for her benefit, but also for the benefit of his siblings since they'll be the folks who eventually inherit the money that the mother doesn't need. But apparently, Chip wasn't such a good son or really a good brother. He got Mrs. Nice to execute a fraudulent power of attorney, gained access to her retirement accounts, and withdrew money for his own benefit. Now, after several years of this, one of Mrs. Nice's daughters, Julianne, caught on to what was happening and sued to have Chip removed from their mother's house and finances. A year later, Chip passed away and Julianne was put in charge of her mother's care and money. She looked through all her mom's past tax returns and saw all the retirement account distributions and all the taxes on those distributions which totaled more than $500,000. Now Julianne decided to refile the returns and seek refunds from the IRS based on the argument that these past returns overstated her mother's income.After all, Mrs. Nice didn't actually get the money, so why should she have to pay taxes on it? The IRS disagreed the case went to Court and the Court sided with the IRS. Not only did Chip deplete his mother's portfolio by making fraudulent withdrawals, but also by creating a tax bill of more than a half million dollars. The lessons here are, well, unfortunately, people become less cognitively sharp and more vulnerable as they get older, and when someone is no longer able to manage their affairs, the person who steps in is often a son or a daughter. But that doesn't mean that person is qualified to handle the finances, either in terms of knowledge or frankly morals. Make sure you have a plan for who will manage your parents money when they're no longer able to, and you should have a plan for your own money as you age. There should be a way for all interested parties to keep an eye on what's happening. If one sibling is in charge of managing mom and dad's money, the other siblings should at least get account statements or be able to log into their accounts and see what's going on. I should point out that I learned this case from Ed Slott's IRA Advisor Newsletter. Ed Slott being a national IRA expert and author of many books, as well as the main man behind the IRAhelp.com website, which is an excellent resource. In the newsletter, Ed wrote that a diligent financial advisor can potentially prevent elder abuse and scams. I think he's right. Getting an objective, experienced financial expert involved might be another line of defense.Alison Southwick: Gather around children because I'm going to tell you a story of When Dreams Become Nightmares. Join me as we enter a haunted house of financial terror because this is the curse of the HGTV Dream House. Thunder. Thanks to Stephen Guedel of Money Magazine for the article I'm about to crib, liberally. Here we go. It was probably a hot, sweltering day, because this story begins and ends in Texas. The Cruz family pulls up to their new dream home. Don, his wife Shelley, and their 10 year old Donald, marvel at the 6,000 square foot mansion that towers above them, more than seven times the size of their old house in Chicago. They can hardly believe it. After many years of trying out of 39 million people, they won HGTV's Dream Home Sweepstakes. The Lake Front Home came fully furnished, along with $250,000 cash prize and an SUV. \"I feel like I'm looking at someone else's house, this can't possibly be ours.\" Shelley said as she beheld the massive great room with its 30 foot ceilings and six foot wide fireplace, the master bedroom suite, the hot tub, the indoor elevator, and the outdoor pool. But little did they know of the financial terror that was lurking in the shadows. In the 10 years that HGTV had been running the sweepstakes, the Cruze's were the first to make the fatal, not fatal, but still unfortunate decision to actually live in the house.It wasn't long before their dream house turned into a financial nightmare. They were used to living off of $40,000 a year, so Don thought they could survive for quite some time on the $250,000 cash prize. But then the financial gremlins emerged. Upkeep on the house was $2,900 a month. Homeowners insurance ran $7,000 annually. That's on top of a $1,000 a month mortgage payment for the house back in Chicago, which they kept just in case. Smart thinking, by the way. Fixing up the family boat, that cost $11,000. A dog run for their three dogs worth $6,000 between family and friends eager to visit the dream home. The Cruzers had company nearly every weekend for about $1,000 apiece in entertaining. They donated $40,000 to charity, and they splurged spending $5,000 on Christmas presents, $2,000 for scuba lessons, and an $1,800 go cart. Within a year, the Cruze's had just $36,000 left from their winnings. But perhaps most terrifying of all, to pay off the tax bill of $672,000 that came with the house car and money as well as cover some other expenses. They had some unfortunate medical bills. They had decided to take out a $1,000,000 loan, which had monthly payments of around $8,000. Within three years, their fate was sealed. The family was out of money and four months behind on loan payments.The Cruzes huddled in the living room, Don sobbed. There was nothing left to do but auction the house for sale and hope that the proceeds covered their bills. While all this happened 15 years ago, strangely, the allure of the HGTV Dream house continues to call to Don. When asked in 2020 if he regretted winning, he said he'd do it all over again. He'd return to the HGTV Dream house if he won today. I guess I need to take away here and the best one I'm seeing is classic, just take the money and run. According to the Country Living Magazine at the time of publication back in 2018, of the 21 people who've won the Dream Home over the year, only six or about 28% actually lived in the home for more than a year. The vast majority either took the cash alternative or sold the house back to the developer within a year of winning. The big reason for selling out is the tax bill, because that is no joke. Federal taxes alone are in the ballpark of 6 to 700,000 and if you had that lying around in the first place, you could just buy your own damn dream house. What do we know of the next HGTV House of Horrors? Not a whole lot. It's located in Anastasia Island, Florida, near St. Augustine and this December, you too can enter to win it if you dare.Robert Brokamp: Our third story, A Tale of Tractor Terror. No collection of tales of money mayhem is complete without a good story about bad estate planning. After all, and I'm sorry to break the news to you, but we're all going to die and we're all going to leave behind a bunch of stuff yet according to Caring.com's 2023, Wills Survey, two out of three Americans do not have any type of estate planning documents that would tell our survivors who should get all that stuff. Our final story is about Cecil George Harris, a farmer in Saskatchewan who rode out into his fields on June 8, 1948. At one point, he climbed down from his tractor to do some maintenance. Unfortunately, he accidentally knocked the tractor into gear and got pinned underneath it. He wasn't found until 10 hours later. He was still alive, but he died the next day at the hospital. Now Cecil didn't have a will or so people thought. After Cecil's death, neighbors noticed that there were some words scrawled under the bumper of the tractor. They read, \"In case I die in this mess, I leave all to the wife, Cecil George Harris.\" Now this is known as a holographic will. In other words, a handwritten will accompanied by the writer's signature. Some courts do not consider such wills valid, but others do. For example, Aretha Franklin's estate was recently settled based on a will she wrote in a notebook found under a couch cushion a year after her death.In Cecil's case, his will scrawled out on his tractor with a pocket knife, was indeed accepted by the court. However, because wills are required to be filed with the court, the fender had to be removed and kept at the courthouse. In 1996, it was donated to the University of Saskatchewan College of Law for public display, and you can find pictures of it on the interwebs. The lesson here, of course, is to get an estate plan. It's quite shocking how many people die without estate planning documents. People you'd think would know better, people like Abraham Lincoln, Jimmy Hendrix, Martin Luther King, Sonny Bono, Picasso, Buddy Holly, Ulysses S Grant, and Prince, just to name a few. Without those documents, the courts decide who gets what, which could take a lot of time and a lot of money.In Prince's case, the first bank appointed to be the administrator of his estate had to drill into the vault that held the master tapes of his music, because apparently Prince was the only person who knew the combination. It took more than a year after Prince's death for a court to name his six siblings as the legitimate heirs to his estate. It was finally settled in 2022, so six years after he died, valuing the total estate at $156 million. At that point two of the six heirs had already passed away. In Cecil Harris' case, his quick thinking while he's pinned under the tractor, spared his family some of the difficulties that come from dying without a will. But you can't rely on being able to write out your intentions during your final moments. Make sure you get at least a will. But a will is just one aspect of a solid estate plan. It should also include healthcare directives that allow someone to make healthcare decisions for you, including whether you want to be kept alive by artificial means. It should also include name and guardians of your minor children if you have them and who will manage their money until they become adults. In many cases, it couldn't include the equation of one or more trusts. All this is best arranged with the help of a qualified experienced estate planning attorney. With that, happy Halloween, everybody.Ricky Mulvey: If you want more Spooky Stories, Bro went on our sister show, the Rule Breaker Investing podcast.

            "title": "Veterans Day warning: Scams targeting veterans are rising \u2014 here's how to avoid them",
            "description": "We celebrate them on Veterans Day and thank them for their service. But fraudsters often focus on veterans because of the benefits and programs available to them, experts say.In October 2020, Larry Cook, a 76-year-old retired Navy commander, received an email purportedly from Amazon confirming the purchase of an iPad. Cook hadn\u2019t purchased the Apple AAPL, +0.69% device and called the number on the email to cancel the order, but the person on the other end of the line wasn\u2019t working for Amazon AMZN, -0.58%. It was a scam that would cost him dearly, his family said.Over the next six months, Cook \u2014 who had suffered a serious stroke the year before \u2014 became the victim of an elaborate scheme in which he was convinced to wire $2.3 million to bank accounts overseas. It was only after Cook passed away in April 2021, that his family figured out what had happened.Cook\u2019s situation underscores the vulnerability of military veterans to financial predators who target them. Government officials and the Department of Veterans Affairs warn that such scams are on the rise.In 2022, the Federal Trade Commission said it received over 150,000 reports of scams from veterans and military retirees that cost them over $414 million, up more than 50 percent from the previous year. While many of the scams are little different than those faced by people who have never served, government watchdogs say veterans are particularly vulnerable to financial predators due to the wide range of education, health care, and housing benefits that are available to them. \u201cSome scams specifically target the military community, using false military affiliations or touting bogus offers for veterans in a cynical ploy to take advantage of servicemembers, veterans, and their families,\u201d Monica Vaca, of the FTC, testified before congress last year.Here are some of the more common frauds that veterans encounter:Veterans are frequently targeted in scams in which the scammer poses as someone else in an effort to get money or personal information from the victim. The fraudster often will masquerade as an official from a government agency or a company that purports to help veterans access programs they are eligible for. In these types of scams, the imposter will be the one to contact you, often claiming there is a limited time to act to receive some benefit. This should be an immediate red flag. Government agencies would never call you with such an offer, experts say.Sometimes, scammers will email a veteran claiming to be from a fake government agency and asking for some personal information. This is a sign of a phishing scam that will use that information to attempt to hack into other accounts.Things to look out for are poor spelling and grammar in the message, suspicious-looking links and unsecure domain addresses (meaning web addresses that begin with http rather than https).Another form of the imposter scam is the romance scam, which often zeroes in on older veterans. Typically the con artist will reach out through social media or via dating sites, targeting widows and widowers to take advantage of their loneliness or isolation.\u201cIf you are a senior citizen and a veteran, scammers have more than one way to play on your heartstrings,\u201d said Mark Kapczynski, of OneRep, a service that helps people remove personal information from the web.Scam artists will often claim to be residing somewhere overseas making it impossible to meet in person. They may keep the correspondence up for months, but eventually will begin asking for money, often to help pay for some kind of emergency. Usually, they will ask for the money to be wired overseas or sent in some hard to trace form, like gift cards or cryptocurrency.In 2020, the FTC said military veterans and those on active duty lost nearly $41 million to such scams. Unscrupulous actors have sometimes set up and advertised sites where one can collect military service records or medical records for a fee. For starters, most of this type of information is available at no cost from the Veterans Administration or the National Archive, experts say.These types of sites can also be vehicles for stealing personal information for use in hacking into accounts, so should be avoided.Veterans\u2019 pensions are a big target for scammers, experts say. Many times, the scammer will pretend to be a veteran themselves in order to make the fraud seem legitimate. Most of these offers propose to invest that money for a bigger payout at the end, in exchange for a fee upfront. But oftentimes the scammer will disappear with the fee.In another form of this scam, known as pension poaching, an unethical financial advisor will offer to structure a veteran\u2019s or a veteran\u2019s family\u2019s assets in a way to increase the value of the pension for which they are eligible. But that often will result in the veteran being sold a product for which the advisor will receive a sizable fee.Veterans are often eligible for preferential lending rates for mortgages. While a great benefit, it does attract its fair share of shady actors.Some illegitimate agents will attempt to get a veteran to refinance their loans purportedly to access an even more beneficial rate, but that will usually come with high fees.Some may claim to be working for a government agency, like the Department of Veterans Affairs, or for a legitimate loan servicer. Serious red flags, however, would be anyone instructing you to suddenly make your mortgage payments to a different account than usual. For those facing foreclosure or having difficulty making their monthly payments, scam artists may offer to help for a fee, despite there being free options available. They may pressure you to sign papers without giving you time to read them through or understand them. In some extreme cases, the fraudster might ask for you to sign over title to your property, claiming it will make it easier to help you stave off foreclosure or some other financial difficulty. Do not do this under any circumstance.Who doesn\u2019t want to hire a vet?One prevalent scam is a phony job post targeting vets. The prospective employer will claim to want to value veterans and want to hire them, but inevitably the so-called headhunter will begin asking for information like a social security number or even bank details. They may even ask for a fee for equipment or training related to the bogus job.Also, those who have done their service are entitled to considerable education benefits through the G.I. Bill. Scammers know this and will often try to get you to pay it to them.Some fly-by-night technical schools or license certification programs may claim to offer scholarships in exchange for upfront fees. Not every school is certified to receive G.I. Bill money, so any institution should be checked against the VA\u2019s list of approved schools.In some major scams, prosecutors have broken up operations that have signed up veterans for limited correspondence courses but then billed the VA for the cost of a full program, draining the vet\u2019s G.I. Bill benefits.\"I am starting to believe he is a cheap dude.\"Lukas is a reporter for MarketWatch focusing on financial investigations.

The tech giant also has a market capitalization of roughly $2.84 trillion, and ranks as the world's largest company.There's no doubt that Apple is an industry-leading player in technology hardware and software, but is the stock still a smart buy at today's prices? Read on to see competing bull and bear cases for the stock presented by two Motley Fool contributors.Image source: Apple.Parkev Tatevosian: My bull case on Apple stock centers on its decades of history designing, creating, and selling innovative tech hardware that people have come to appreciate. Indeed, it is this capability of innovating that is likely to make Apple shareholders wealthier over the coming years.The iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and AirPods are a few of the tech items you see daily, even if you don't own one of these products yourself. Sales of the aforementioned products have boosted Apple's revenue from $171 billion in 2013 to $394 billion in 2022. Apple has cleverly built a family of products that complement each other. An Apple Watch is more useful if you have an iPhone, and vice versa. This characteristic makes it more likely that consumers will stick to Apple's ecosystem when any items need upgrading. What makes Apple an attractive investment is that it has accomplished those feats profitably. From 2013 to 2022, Apple's operating income increased from $49 billion to $119 billion. Overall, Apple has demonstrated it can repeatedly deliver innovative technologies to customers while simultaneously expanding the business's profits. Fortunately for investors, they can buy this company at a fair valuation. AAPL PE Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YChartsApple is trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of roughly 26, which is a fair price considering the growth in revenue and profits mentioned earlier. It can be tempting to look for bargains in the stock market, but paying a reasonable price for an excellent business is also a good strategy to build wealth in the long run.Keith Noonan: Before diving into potential bearish scenarios for Apple stock, I should clarify that I think the stock stands a good chance of beating the market over the long term. As Parkev outlined above, the company has built an impressive ecosystem of products and services -- and it's an absolute monster of a profit-generating machine.But while Apple has certainly served up some big innovations in the past, its recent hardware and software releases have been largely iterative. When it comes to the iPhone hardware that generates a huge portion of the company's overall sales and profits, the tech giant's annual hardware refreshes have largely come down to marginal improvements for camera technology and a few other bells and whistles in recent years.Delivering relatively small technological improvements hasn't stopped the iPhone from serving up very impressive sales because Apple has an incredibly loyal customer base. The company arguably has the world's most valuable brand, and it's built a lifestyle around its products. But with the possible exception of its AirPods, Apple hasn't exactly delivered surprising product wins in recent years.While the company is readying its augmented reality glasses and reportedly working on a self-driving smart car and other projects, it remains to be seen whether its new product offerings will wind up being successful. And notably, the company hasn't had much to show when it comes to artificial intelligence (AI).Apple's massive user base gives it some inherent foundational strength in the AI space, but I think it would be hard to argue that the company has stronger footing than Microsoft based on what we've seen so far. AI is poised to be an absolute game changer, and there's a risk that Apple's overall position in tech will weaken if the company doesn't knock it out of the park with its own initiatives.There's no doubt that Apple is a great company that deserves somewhat of a valuation premium. But the business is coming off four consecutive quarters of sales declines. Even with its many successes and strengths, Apple still has a lot of proving to do. If new product and service initiatives can't drive stronger growth, the stock could struggle or stagnate.If you're looking for blue-chip technology stocks with strong industry position and great brand strength, there's a lot to like about Apple. The company remains enormously profitable, and it has an impressive history of delivering successful products and services.On the other hand, investors shouldn't dismiss the potential near-term downside risks or the possibility that the stock could deliver weaker-than-expected long-term performance. Apple's previous successes don't guarantee that it will score big wins in new categories, and it's possible the tech giant will face some disruptive pressures amid AI trends or see some of its other growth bets fall short.For most investors, taking a buy-and-hold approach to Apple still looks like a sensible move. But it's also a good idea to study and weigh bearish scenarios before going all in on the stock.Keith Noonan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*They just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now\u2026 and Starbucks wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.See the 10 stocks *Stock Advisor returns as of November 6, 2023 This video was recorded on Nov. 03, 2023.Dylan Lewis: We've got the latest on three household names and three stocks that are down big, but might be poised for a turnaround. Motley Fool Money starts now. It's the Motley fool Money radio show. I'm Dylan Lewis. Joining me over the airwaves, it's Motley Fool senior analyst, Matt Argersinger, Ron Gross. Gentlemen, great to have you both with.Ron Gross: How are you doing Dylan?Dylan Lewis: We've got some big earnings to run through, but first we're going to take a snapshot of the big macro. Ron, we had a Fed meeting this week. We had jobs data this week, what did you see?Ron Gross: It's been an interesting week, a lot of volatility. On Wednesday, the Fed unanimously easy for me to say, agreed to hold rates steady. As you will recall, that's following a string of 11 rate hikes, four in 2023, and Chair Jerome Powell said, getting inflation down to 2% has a \"long way to go\". Obviously, the investors, Wall Street are hearing higher longer and they don't typically like higher or longer, but toward the end of the week, we got some interesting data that caused treasury yields to back off and they had been very high, as high as since 2007, which is part of the cause for the weakness we're seeing in the market. We saw a weaker than expected jobs report come in. We saw wage inflation moderating. Two things that say, maybe the economy is cooling off, maybe the Fed is doing a good job in lowering our inflation rate, somewhere down closer to two. The unemployment rate ticked up a bit to 3.9%. Yields came down, stock market shot up later in the week, Thursday and Friday. Let's see what next week brings, but this week ended very strong.Dylan Lewis: We saw some big time earnings results from some big time companies. We can get the earnings beat started and talk through some of those big reactions we saw Ron. Let's start with Starbucks. Shares up over 10% after the company reported earnings and revenue ahead of expectations. Matt, we joked earlier, I think maybe a couple of weeks ago, about the absurdity of the high priced Starbucks menu items. Are those double shot drinks doing the heavy lifting here?Matt Argersinger: They are. The good news is yes, they are and Starbucks has been really able to pass along price increases, unlike a lot of other companies we'll probably talk about, but the good news is, it's coming from pol places. It's not just price increases, it's also coming from transactions. It hasn't felt really good to be a Starbucks shareholder lately. Going into the earnings report, you had a stock that's been mostly flat over the past three years. It's really underperformed the market. There's been uncertainty about who was going to be CEO and how long Howard Schultz would stay around, and of course, growth has stagnated, particularly in China, but here we go. Today it feels pretty good to be a shareholder. The Q4 results are really solid. Global, comparable store sales were up 8% and as I mentioned, it wasn't just average ticket, it was also transactions. It's not like Starbucks is seeing any drop off in customer traffic or transactions. We've seen a lot of companies report growth that's been totally based on price and not on volumes. Starbucks is winning on both ends. US comps were up 8%. China has been a little bit of struggle comps, there were up 5% and total revenue was up 11% to 9.4 billion. Probably the best part of the report in the Q4 was the operating margin which was up 300 basis points, earnings per share, up 31% to $1.06. All these figures were way ahead of a consensus. Finally the 90 day after rewards member is something I'd pay attention to. That number was up 14% in the US to 32.6 million members. Quite a strong finish to fiscal 2023 for Starbucks.Dylan Lewis: Those are incredibly strong results and I know it's not all that Starbucks had for the Street this week. Their CEO Laxman Narasimhan unveiled the company's new long term strategy for the coffee chain. Matt, what's the plan?Matt Argersinger: Yes, Narasimhan and the team held a special call with Starbucks shareholders. He outlined his new long term strategy and he's calling it, wait for it, the triple shot reinvention with two pumps. [LAUGHTER] This beverage order has five elements to it guys. One, elevating the brand. Two, strengthening and scaling the company's digital presence. Three, becoming truly global. Then here are the two pumps. We got one pump for unlocking efficiencies and a second pump for reinvigorating the partner culture. Don't have a lot of time to go into the details and context behind each of these, but there are a lot of investors who are probably wincing a bit, and I was certainly at the tortured coffee metaphor here, but they probably didn't wince at the company's guidance for fiscal 2024, so comps growth between 5 and 7%. Revenue growth between 10 12%. Earnings growth between 15 and 20%, and Narasimhan thinks those numbers are actually pretty sustainable for the next several years, not just in this new fiscal year. If Starbucks can meet these kinds of growth rates, I think shareholders are going to be feeling pretty good.Ron Gross: I'd advocate for a third pump where we put the milk back out on the counter so I can put my own milk in my coffee once again, like we used to do pre-COVID.Dylan Lewis: I would call that an efficiency gain, Ron. That's going to help through putting that milk out there. I'm 100% with you. I want to be able to dictate the color of my own coffee. We had results from Apple as well this week. Another company that needs no introduction, Ron. We just talked Starbucks results. The story there was some strength in China. Not exactly the case with Apple's results.Ron Gross: No, really the opposite. Dylan, it ain't easy being a $2.7 trillion company. Why don't you try it sometime. A lot of stuff has to go right, and in this case, not everything is going well. Earnings were better than expected, and we'll talk about that in a second. Sales were disappointing, guidance was disappointing. Sales were down slightly, but this was the fourth consecutive quarter of declines. For market leading Apple, that's not what investors are looking to see. The iPhone business was up 2.8% for new iPhone 15 introduced in September, but all other categories basically showed weakness. Mac down 34%. iPad down 10%. Wearables down 3%. Only bright spot in addition to the iPhone was the service segment, which was up about 16%, that's Apple Care, iCloud storage, app store sales deals with Google. That was OK. That's actually the second largest segment now behind iPhone. It's important that that had some strength, but as you said, China, one of the bigger challenges. Apple reported its lowest revenue from the Greater China region since mid 2022. iPhone demand was strong, but Mac and iPad were very weak. Overall, China revenue fell 2.5%. Boiling all this down, you got some help from a lower tax rate, you got some help from the fact that they buy shares back, so shares outstanding were down. Earnings per share actually managed to grow pretty nicely at 13%. Not too bad. Company continues to return cash to shareholders, has $162 billion in the bank. Twenty-seven times forward earnings got to see if some growth folks, otherwise that starts to look pretty expensive.Matt Argersinger: You hit that, the last point about valuation run and that's where I was going to go. Just if you looked at Apple entering the year, it was trading for around 21, 22 times earnings. A slight premium to the overall market, definitely always justified for something like Apple. But the stock is up 35% year to date. Even through these earnings, I didn't realize it had such a good year. Now, as you mentioned, about 27 times earnings feels like a premium valuation. Even Warren Buffett, who of course owns and loves Apple, is probably a little nervous about where the stock is trading. I notice Berkshire Hathaway was a steady buyer of the stock in last year and coming into the year, but he hasn't bought any shares over the last couple of quarters. I'm wondering if he's seeing the same valuation concerns that we are.Ron Gross: It could be. A lot of the Talking Heads are focused on the fact that it's down 10, 11% from it's higher earlier in the year, but as you mentioned, still up 35% despite that pullback and selling rather richly at the moment. One of my biggest positions though, so I've got my fingers crossed. [laughs]Dylan Lewis: Our final name for the big earnings wrap up, Shopify. The company's shares are up 25% this week after a strong earnings report pushed them higher. Matt, what is behind the big pop?Matt Argersinger: Well yeah, hard to find anything not to like about Shopify results. Gross merchandise volume up 22% to 56.2 billion. That's a big number. The merchant solutions business which is the biggest revenue segment, it's where Shopify help sellers with payments, shipping, and working capital. Revenue there was up 24% and a big reason for that was Shopify payments. The gross payments volume grew to 32.8 billion and accounted for 58% of Shopify's gross merchandise volume. Their payments infrastructure is definitely gain an attraction within their customer base. You turn to subscription solutions, revenue there was up 29%, and part of the growth here was really about pricing. Shopify raised prices on its basic and premium plans and didn't note any meaningful drop-off in subscribers after doing that. Monthly recurring revenue was up 32%. Now, investors have gotten used to these growth rates on the top line, which are obviously still very impressive. But I think what's new with Shopify is just the profitability now. We know the company sold its logistics business to a partner over the summer, so taking all those operating and CapEx costs out of the equation has really boosted the company's cash flow. Operating income in the quarter was 122 million. That compares to an operating loss of 346 million a year ago. Free cash flow was 276 million and free cash flow margin was 16% and management noted that they expect that cash flow margin to remain in the high teens in the current quarter as well. This is a fast-growing company, but also a much more profitable company. I think that is what has investors excited. The only thing I would say is this is still a company that does a lot of stock-based compensation, over 100 million in the third quarter alone, so you have to take that free cash flow with a little grain of salt. Ron Shopify President Harley Finkelstein appeared on CNBC this week and I think he might owe you five bucks, because he said a company was firing on all cylinders, talking about the strong growth, the cost, discipline, and continuing to see some big brands coming over. I want to hear it from the man himself though. Do you agree with the assessment?Ron Gross: I saw some of that interview and I agree that they certainly at the moment they're firing on all cylinders. He was very happy to be reporting those results to the interviewer for sure.Dylan Lewis: Well, now you is your royalty, so it's great you go around. The show pays for itself. Coming up after the break, we've got one company riding the trend of convenience and a foul stock up 40% since reporting stay right here. This is Motley Fool Money.Dylan Lewis: Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis, Joined again over the airwaves by Matt Argersinger and Ron Gross. We're going to pick up right where we left off with earnings this time though, checking on three companies that have had a bit of a rough run over the past few years but might be showing some signs of life. Ron, first one up is DoorDash Company shares up nearly 20% after the leading food delivery company reported recent orders on the platform that we're hitting record levels. Based on the company's guidance, Ron seems like they're expecting some good times to continue.Ron Gross: Yes, but stock's up 80% this year. Thirty-five billion dollar market gap for DoorDash. Does that sound right? Let's get into some of the numbers and we can discuss that they did post their strongest quarter since going public in 2020. Good for them. I am a customer, probably use it too often, so I'm with them. They projected better than expected growth and adjusted earnings for the current quarter. That's strong guidance as well. Part of the reason that we really saw the stock take off. Total order value on the app and total number of orders both rose 24% strong business, restaurants stayed strong, grocery business doubled. Revenue was up 27% as a result. Expenses were managed well and they managed to trim overall losses to 75 million. I will remind you it's a $35 billion market gap and they're trimming losses. They do have adjusted EBITDA dial. We play with some of the numbers and we see that it came in at 344 million, its strongest ever. It's a four fold increase over last year, 878 million in free cash flow on a trailing 12 month basis. Not profitable yet, but they are producing free cash flow if we do some adjusting, 35 times adjusted EBITDA though here. They've got to grow into this value in a humongous way. Can they do it? That's going to take some time I think, but it'll be fun to watch.Dylan Lewis: Yeah, we might help them grow into that valuation. Ron is this idea of the macro trend of convenience. CEO Tony Ju has talked about that. It sounds like you're helping them out with some of those orders yourself, but generally the gist is consumers seem pretty happy to sit at home and if they can find some of those categories like grocery and expand beyond conventional food delivery, there might be something there for them.Ron Gross: I think so. I think this is a business and I think it will be a profitable business if expenses are controlled appropriately. I just don't know if a 35 billion market cap is appropriate. Time will tell.Dylan Lewis: We have a rough week for match shareholders. The online dating company down over 10% after reporting third-quarter earnings. Matt, it seemed like the key area of concern here was user growth trends especially with tender.Matt Argersinger: That's the story. If you compare the stock chart of Match group with Zoom over the past five years, you'll see almost what looks like a perfect correlation. Like Zoom, Match was that perfect pandemic stock. People stuck at home. There wasn't a opportunities for social interactions. Match's services really boomed and the stock really behaved like that for a year or so. But now stock is down more than 80% of its high. It's close to a seven year low. I couldn't believe it when I looked at it. I think the results will tell you that unlike a Starbucks or a Shopify, subscribers here tend to be pretty price sensitive. Match group has raised or as management says, optimize pricing over the past year for many of its services, including tender, and I think that's helped revenue in the short term. But subscriber numbers are way down across the board. Paying members fell 800,000-15.7 million, in the third quarter. Tinder was the big loser, paying members there fell 6%, and revenue guidance for the current quarters was below management's prior guidance. All that taken together really hit the stock hard. I think this is somewhat of a network effects type of business. I'm not a user, I can't confirm that. But I think when you start losing subscribers in a business like this, the momentum of the business can really fall off. On the positive side, margins are higher, that's what the price hikes are doing. The business is generating a lot of free cash, but I think unless they can get subscriber growth going again. I don't know, there might be a lower floor for the stock.Dylan Lewis: We'll wrap with another name in convenience, Roku. Shares of the streaming and ad company up 40%, four 0% following earning. Ron, this report felt like a company that had some good news and desperately needed some good news.Ron Gross: It really did. Times have been tough here and there, but up 100% this year, the stock. It's getting some love for sure from investors. This was a strong report with signs of an advertising rebound and cost cutting. Helping the bottom line and future guidance, which I think really has got investors excited. Revenue was up 20%, platform revenue, which includes their ad sales and their distribution deals, and the Roku channel was up 18%, Roku added 2.3 million active accounts in the quarter. That's up 16% revenue per active user was down 7% year over year, but it was actually up 1% on a sequential basis. Moving in the right direction, we've got to get that number moving a little bit more quickly, more strongly. Gross margins narrowed a bit. Device margin growth was offset by narrowing platform gross margins, led to an adjusted EBITDA number. Again, adjusted, we have to play with some of the numbers to get this of $43 billion positive. Management said it remains cautious and certain amid an uncertain macro environment and an uneven ad market recovery. But they did guide to adjusted eta of $10 million for the fourth quarter. This is an $11 billion market cap company. Not putting up great numbers but maybe they're on track right now, they remain committed to positive adjusted EBITDA for full year 2024.Dylan Lewis: Ron, I look at this name and some of the others and I think it's possible that we might be seeing some bottoming with some of these big growth text stock names. Is that what you're seeing here?Ron Gross: Bottoming, it's interesting though, in the current interest rates environment, you've got to put up some strong numbers, still support some of these market caps. They're still pretty high. Just not as high as they were.Dylan Lewis: Ron and Matt, we'll see you guys a little bit later in the show. Up next we've got a breakdown of the winds the United Auto workers notched in their deals with Ford, Stellantis, and GM. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool MoneyRon Gross:Well, now Lord, Mr. Ford, I just wish that you could see what your simple horseless carriage has become.Dylan Lewis: Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis. Detroit might be able to breathe a sigh of relief as of weeks end, Ford, GM, and Stellantis all have established tentative deals with the United Auto Workers Union. The details are down and now it's up to union members to accept the contracts. We went to economist Marc Robinson, who worked for GM for over three decades, advising on negotiations, labor, and strategy for a breakdown on how the deals came together and lessons from these negotiations. Marc, we spoke with you in early October, and at the time, the conversation with the UAW and the automakers was these two sides and how they are angling in their negotiations. Very different story now.Last week, we saw that there was a deal struck with Ford. We have news that there's a deal with Stellantis and GM. What happened over the last couple of weeks since we last checked in with you?Marc Robinson: Well, they went through their escalation strategy, which they've been telegraphing for a while. They stopped firing shots across the bow and walked out of a negotiation session with Ford a couple of weeks ago, and struck Ford's most profitable plant, its Kentucky Truck Plant. They then waited actually two weeks to strike GM and Stellantis as most profitable plant. The day after they struck the GM's most profitable plant, they announced a tentative agreement with Ford. Some of this was kabuki, it was show, Shawn Fain had to demonstrate to its members that they had, as he put it on Sunday, gotten every last dime that was on the table. Looking at the deal, he got a lot of dimes. He got so many major advances for the members, but despite this extraordinary agreement, he still had to be and is today still concerned about ratification.Dylan Lewis: Marc, let's talk a little bit about some of the advances that you were talking about there. I think if you're looking at the UAW side, from my perspective, it seems like the major wins that we're seeing based on what we know about these deals are significant pay raises, the return of cost of living adjustments, family relief. Are there some other things that really jump out to you as big wins for the UAW?Marc Robinson: Yes. It was not just that they got significant wage increases overall. They essentially got rid of the two tier system, and it was actually multi tier system. The Detroit 3 had agreed, essentially, over the years, to bring some jobs back in or keep some plants open basically under concessions that the union made about wages and work rules. They just undid that. If I were the companies, I wouldn't expect that kind of possibility to be out there in the future, and that they may have some remorse about the decisions they made back then. They also covered these, in some cases, plants that didn't even exist yet. These joint venture battery plants that the Detroit 3 had in unprecedented fashion, set up with Korean battery suppliers, Samsung and LG Chem. Even though they weren't under the national agreement, in theory, the companies didn't even have to talk about them with the UAW as part of these national negotiations. They agreed to bring them under the national contract at assembly plant wages. In the case of Ford and Stellantis, who hadn't even opened up their plants yet, they agreed through essentially a sleight of hand to instantly have them be unionized and have them be under again at the national agreement wages. That was a massive win for the UAW, it's a big strategic defeat for the Detroit automakers. They may end up even rethinking their long-term battery strategy as a result of this.Dylan Lewis: Marc, it seems like this was generally something that led to a lot of advances for the UAW. From the automaker perspective, are there wins? Because so much of the coverage and the press that I see on this is basically the UAW got a lot of what they were looking for.Marc Robinson: I can't see any major wins that the automakers got. The only thing they were able to not agree to some things that the UAW demanded, like defined benefit pensions for new or higher workers, and big increases in existing pensions, and 32-hour work week, which the union I think never was very serious about. My rough farmers math is that each of the companies has another two billion dollars a year in labor cost by the end of the agreement. That's more than 33% increase in their labor costs, maybe up to 40%. That's a massive hit. The other thing is that, Ford, for example, was very proud of its non-confrontational relationship with the union and they viewed that as a competitive advantage over General Motors. Well, not only did Ford get struck, which is already a defeat for that strategy, but Shawn Fain went out of his way to diss the chairman and the CEO of Ford. He stood up Bill Ford, the chairman of the board, who was coming in for a special conversation with him in advance of the strike. He walked out 10 minutes into an important negotiation session and struck for his most profitable plan. That's not gentlemanly behavior, which I'm sure Shawn Fain would be perfectly comfortable being ungentlemanly. But there are hard feelings in the companies about this strike.Dylan Lewis: You mentioned Shawn Fain there and the approach from the UAW with this strike was new and different, and Shawn Fain is a very new and different union leader. Do you think that contributed to the success of the negotiations?Marc Robinson: Yes. I think that his style and aggressiveness contributed. There was a very interesting story in the Wall Street Journal about the 330 something advisors that Shawn Fain hired, not union members, I mean they came in as staffers. The combination of that fresh thinking and more strategic thinking and more nimble communications clearly had an impact on the strike. I think that some of the negotiation tactics were similar to things I've heard about for how Donald Trump negotiates. For example, GM, before it signed the tentative agreement, the UAW escalated and struck yet another plant just before the deal. That couldn't have been because GM was unwilling to sign the pattern. GM would have agreed to the pattern economics. A week earlier hey were said they were very close to a deal. What I think happened is that the union negotiators came into that session trying to get all three deals done at once. Again, there's no tradition around that. They then said, we want more here and we want more there. They had already agreed to not take more, but they grabbed it and that led to more confrontation, and probably more concessions from the Detroit three. But it's not a way they are used to negotiating and it may have some long term consequences for how they approach the union in the future.Dylan Lewis: Do you think that there are tactics that other labor groups and maybe other industries might borrow from with what the UAW did?Marc Robinson: Shawn Fain is hoping that in May 1, 2028, there are many union contracts that expire on the same day. He wants to call a general strike. He wants to change the way unions are perceived and bargain in America. Not sure he'll succeed, but definitely he wants to be leading a revitalized labor movement. His advisors, there's apparently a playbook that they published that they more or less followed. My guess is other unions will be downloading copies of that playbook.Dylan Lewis: You have a C-Suite newsletter that you write. Right after the Ford deal was announced, you wrote that the gains were incredibly impressive. This is a record contract by any measure. However, it is something that still needs to be ratified. This is what we need to put to an end here. Are there reasons to worry about that?Marc Robinson: Absolutely. Shawn Fain has raised expectations extraordinarily high. That may be some of the downside of his tactics is that the companies basically knew that the workers were going to be had very high expectations, and they wouldn't be able to get out of this with a cheaper contract just by waiting a couple more weeks. Just recently, the union members rejected a proposed agreement, a tentative agreement at Mack Trucks. Now it wasn't nearly as rich as the Detroit 3 agreement, which is in fact part of his problem. In 2015, what's now slants rejected a national agreement. There is history of it, there's a risk of it. One thing that Fain is clearly trying to do is to create the sense that the strike is over with his members by getting, reaching tentative agreements at all three, and ratifying all three and calling the workers back to work before ratification. He's trying to create a fait accompli, he may succeed, but there's a risk that he won't and if he doesn't, if there's a failed ratification at any one of the three, it's chaos.Dylan Lewis: You're a game theorist and last time we had Jan, you were talking about how these are economic conversations and financial conversations, certainly for the union workers, but also, there is political posturing that goes on here and, right after the Ford deal was announced in principle, the company revealed that they expect it will add about $850 per vehicle to their manufacturing costs. For our audience as an investing audience is a financial disclosure. But I'm curious, is that also political posturing as we start thinking about things like ratification and the relationship between these automakers and their workers going forward?Marc Robinson: Yes. They're also coming out with statements about how much the strike costs them. I would take those statements with a grain of salt because there have been very few people who have walked away from a dealership not having a car or truck that they wanted even with these strikes. Seems as though they could probably, with a little bit of overtime, make up for a large fraction of whatever they lost in a production during the strike. I think the accounting may allow them to show smaller earnings impact down the road. Then the headline figure on the cost of the strike would suggest.Dylan Lewis: Marc, we're certainly not rooting for any more labor disputes or for people to be on the sidelines not working. But if that's the case, we'll be coming back to you and talking again soon. I really appreciate your time.Marc Robinson: Pleasure talking to you.Dylan Lewis: Listeners, you can catch Marc's latest writings at C-Suite on substack, and if you're interested in stock ideas, the Motley Fool has you covered there too, especially if you're interested in dividends.

You're listening to Motley Fool Money.Dylan Lewis: As always, people on the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell anything based solely on what you hear. I'm Bill Lewis, joined again by Matt Argersinger and Ron Gross. Let's get over to stocks on our radar. Our man behind the glass, Rick Engdahl, is going to hit you with a question for our radar stocks round. Ron, you're up first. What are you looking at this week?Ron Gross: This is an interesting one that caught my eye from our friends over at our microcap service firecrackers and it's WK, Kellogg, KLG. It's the number two seller of ready to eat cereal in America, Number 1 in Canada and the Caribbean and owns nine of the top 20 brands. That's Frosted Flakes, Rice Krispies, Raisin Bran, Fruit Loops, Frosted Mini-Wheats, and Special K. I happen to love cereal. Don't eat enough, but I should. It's delicious. It's still the top breakfast choice for kids. But there's a lot of competition out there from healthier food, so there has been some weakness here. It was recently spun off from the parent company, which is now known as Kellanova ticker, symbol K. They hold onto some of the international brands and they kept a rice crispy treat business that was smart because they are delicious. But we're left with this small microcap company, Kellogg. They've definitely had some problems. The shares are off significantly since it went public. That could create an opportunity. It's only a $900 million market cap company. So if they can put up add numbers of what they're hoping, which could be up to 400 million annually for a $900 million market cap company, this could be very interesting. It's a little dicey though, because it is in a category that is showing declines and we really don't see any significant catalyst from a business perspective in the foreseeable future.Dylan Lewis: Rick, sounds like we've got a pure play cereal company here. What's your question?Rick Engdahl: Yeah, I can't imagine a world without fruit loops that's clear. [laughs] Ron.Ron Gross: Yes.Rick Engdahl: I know the answer, but cereal first or milk first?Ron Gross: Definitely cereal first, right?Rick Engdahl: I've heard arguments the other way and I just don't believe it's. I just wanted to see if there was.Dylan Lewis: You want the milk to water fall down over the cereal so that you don't want to dry stuff on top. I mean, we're all sensible people here. We know how this works.Ron Gross: Not anarchy. [laughs]Dylan Lewis: Matt, what is on your radar this week?Matt Argersinger: I'm looking at Quest Diagnostics, tickers, DGX. It's a leading diagnostics and blood testing company. Think of Theranos, except legal and ethical. It pretty much operates at duopoly with Lab Corp, so most hospitals and clinics will use one or the other or both to outsource blood tests. Obviously quest revenue really soared in 2020, 2021 because of COVID 19 testing. No surprise that's fallen off big time. In fact, their COVID 19 testing revenue fell 92% year over year in the third quarter. But what's been great about the company and the results is just how well their base or non COVID testing business has held up volumes there were up almost 6% in the quarter that was well ahead of what management was expecting. Because of that resilience, management keeps raising full year guidance. Earnings per share are not expected to be between $8.65 and $8.75 for the full year. They're also expecting to generate at least 900 million in free cash flow. This is a really cash flow heavy business. Management tends to use that free cash flow to either make acquisitions pay a steady dividend, which they do, and buy back shares, and I think at less than 16 times earnings, it trades for a below market multiple. Yet it's a very strong cash flowing business with a really good competitive position, so I like where quest diagnostics is right now.Dylan Lewis: Rick, a question about quest.Rick Engdahl: Yes, but, [laughs] so in my extensive research for this segment here, I went to the website and the first thing that popped up was a photograph of a very healthy woman working on a laptop while doing a plank and smiling and I'm wondering, is this company just over promising? [laughs]Dylan Lewis: It could be, but it's, it's aspirational and it's just showing you, what we're all hoping to achieve in life.Rick Engdahl: Yeah.Dylan Lewis: It's a lifestyle brand, Rick.Rick Engdahl: Exactly.Dylan Lewis: Which one's going on your watch list?Rick Engdahl: I think I got to go with the fruit loops.Dylan Lewis: Got to. How can you turn that down?Rick Engdahl: I might do a plank while I'm meeting them.Dylan Lewis: That's good balance. Rick, thanks for weighing in on our radar stocks. Matt and Ron thank you for bringing them to us. That's gonna do it for this week's Smart Fool Money radio show. Thanks for listening.

Learn MoreMacroeconomic headwinds have burdened companies across multiple markets this year, with consumer-reliant businesses being some of the hardest hit. Investors have pulled back on some of the historically most successful companies despite delivering years of long-term growth. As a result, now is an excellent time to consider buying the dip on stocks that are likely to flourish in the coming years.Apple (AAPL 0.74%) and Disney (DIS -0.11%) haven't had it easy in 2023, with their stocks tumbling 7% and 5%, respectively, since the start of July. However, these companies remain the biggest names in their respective industries and will likely provide significant stock growth to investors over the long haul.So, here are two attractive growth stocks to buy on the dip.Apple posted four consecutive quarters of revenue declines in its fiscal 2023, with total sales dipping 3% year over year. The company suffered from marketwide decreases in consumer spending, which brought revenue tumbling across its product categories.Despite market challenges, shoppers have continued to show a strong preference for Apple's products, which will likely pay off over the long term. Counterpoint Research states that U.S. smartphone shipments decreased by 19% in the third quarter of 2023, with Samsung and Alphabet experiencing sales declines of 26% and 37%, respectively. Yet, the same period saw Apple report a more moderate decline of 11%, allowing it to retain its 55% market share in smartphones.Moreover, while consumers haven't been keen to upgrade their devices amid spikes in inflation, Apple has still profited significantly from the digital services it offers through its products. Subscription-based platforms such as Apple TV+, Music, iCloud, and more have diversified Apple's business and proven less vulnerable to economic headwinds. Services revenue rose 9% in 2023 as profit margins hit 72%, remaining a bright spot for the company. Shares in Apple have soared 255% over the last five years, outperforming rivals Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon. The company has a history of being one of the most reliable growth stocks over the long term and is well positioned to deliver substantial gains once the tech market recovers. The recent dip in its shares has only made its stock more attractive, with now being an excellent time to invest in Apple.It hasn't been easy to be a Disney investor in recent years. The Covid-19 pandemic shuttered large portions of its business as theater and theme park closures stole billions of dollars in revenue. Then, an economic downturn in 2022 made it costly to expand in the streaming market, triggering countless restructuring moves to get the company back on track. As a result, Disney's stock is down 34% over the last three years. However, the entertainment giant is in profitability mode and making big changes to its business to see significant growth over the long term. A bright spot for Disney has been its theme parks, experiences, and products division, which reported a 13% rise in revenue in the third quarter of 2023. Meanwhile, park admission sales increased by 18%. As a result, the company is heavily investing in improving guest experiences by expanding its parks worldwide while also introducing higher ticket prices and monetizing various aspects of the business.One of Disney's weakest points over the last year has been its direct-to-consumer segment, which includes revenue from its various streaming platforms. However, it appears to be gradually inching toward profitability. The segment posted operating losses of $512 million in Q3, nearly half the losses it reported in the year-ago quarter. The company plans to introduce another price hike to its subscribers as it works to find a balance between offering value and meeting its bottom line.Disney will report its fourth-quarter 2023 results this week, with expectations that it will reinstate its dividend after removing it during pandemic lockdowns. The company promised to bring it back before the end of the calendar year, which is quickly approaching. The return of its dividend would be a huge win for Disney and its stock, illustrating management's optimism for its future growth.The Walt Disney Company isn't out of the woods after recent challenges. However, it remains one of the world's most recognizable brands, with millions of loyal customers. Recent restructuring moves, such as changing its CFO and pivoting its business away from streaming, are favorable for its long-term future. Now could be an excellent time to buy its stock for a bargain price, with plans to hold over many years.Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool\u2019s board of directors.

            "title": "Can You Buy Penny Stocks In An IRA? The Answer May Surprise You",
            "description": "You can buy penny stocks with an IRA and here's how.\nThe post Can You Buy Penny Stocks In An IRA? The Answer May Surprise You appeared first on Penny Stocks to Buy, Picks, News and Information | PennyStocks.com.Penny stocks, defined as shares trading at less than $5 each, offer a unique slice of the stock market. This straightforward definition often gets muddled in conversation. Contrary to some beliefs, penny stocks aren\u2019t limited to Over-The-Counter (OTC) markets. In fact, platforms like Robinhood list numerous penny stocks, with some even trading below $1.The journey into penny stocks is fraught with risks. These companies frequently lack comprehensive public disclosures or financial reports, making informed trading a challenge. For enthusiastic day traders, diligent research is non-negotiable. Grasping the underlying reasons behind a stock\u2019s movement is crucial, just as much as spotting upward trends. While fleeting rumors can drive short-term spikes, substantial corporate developments tend to have a more enduring impact.Diverse sources should inform your research. Don\u2019t rely solely on a company\u2019s official announcements. Delve into their financial filings, social media presence, and other communication channels to glean timely information. We have seen instances where a mere social media post from a company has sparked significant movement in its penny stock, underscoring the value of early information discovery.Here\u2019s a question that comes up every year, mainly around tax time: Can you buy penny stocks in an IRA?First, IRA refers to the Individual Retirement Account. Many of today\u2019s investors want to benefit from short-term trading by utilizing any investment account. So it\u2019s no wonder why someone would ask, \u201cCan you buy penny stocks in an IRA?\u201d Similarly, people will also wonder, \u201cCan I buy penny stocks with my 401(k)?\u201cYou might associate IRAs with blue-chip stocks and traditionally \u201csafe\u201d investments. It isn\u2019t unlikely to see shares of companies like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM), and even Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) in many IRAs. But, the fact of the matter is that these aren\u2019t the only kinds of stocks to buy with an IRA.Some IRAs can also be used to buy penny stocks; believe it or not. Some invest in their IRA by hiring an advisor. The advisor will hopefully guide you to invest it in a way that meets your specific financial goals. However, you should understand that trading with your IRA will involve certain fees if you want to take money out before your retirement years. However, you can also invest in IRAs in a more self-directed fashion. Many platforms offer this option. Most of the best online brokers offer options to open and manage your own retirement account; IRAs included.There are many apps and websites involved in this field like TD Ameritrade and E*Trade. However, some platforms like Robinhood don\u2019t allow this option as of right now. Penny stock investors are generally concerned about the fees and charges. So, if you are highly concerned about the transaction fees and charges, choose your broker accordingly.Here is where the conversation gets interesting. Many of those looking to buy penny stocks in an IRA are expecting certain advantages. One of which, they hope to gain involves tax advantages. Now, there are certain advantages but always consult a tax professional to discuss the most updated rules. When it comes to IRAs there are two types for individuals. These are the traditional IRA and a Roth IRA. Both allow you to contribute a certain amount of money. Here\u2019s what the IRS says regarding that amount:For 2023 the total contributions you make each year to all of your traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs can\u2019t be more than $6,500. ($7,500 if you\u2019re age 50 or older), or If less, your taxable compensation for the yearTraditional IRA contributions may be tax-deductible however, this deduction might have limits if you or your spouse is covered by a workplace retirement plan, for example. Roth IRA contributions may be limited based on individual filing status and income and your contributions aren\u2019t deductible.*Again, consult a tax professional to get the most updated information. However, as it stands right now, in most cases, short- or long-term gains in your IRA aren\u2019t taxed until you actually take the money out of the account. Since it\u2019s technically a retirement account, you won\u2019t be likely to touch that money for quite some time. When you do start taking qualified distributions, they\u2019re typically taxed as ordinary income. However, something important for younger traders is this: You can take money out early, however, if it\u2019s before age 59 \u00bd, you might have to pay an additional 10% tax for early withdrawals.End Notes:https://www.irs. gov/retirement-plans/traditional-and-roth-irasMidam Ventures, LLC | (305) 306-3854 | 1501 Venera Ave, Coral Gables, FL 33146 | news@pennystocks.comYour email address will not be published.

This indicator, with a great track record, is popular among long term investors to stay in tune with the market and among short term traders to independently undertake quick trades.It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror.Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider holding \ud83d\udd12 in cash or Treasury bills or allocated to short-term tactical trades; and short to medium-term hedges of \ud83d\udd12, and short term hedges of \ud83d\udd12. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of seven year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.The Arora Report is known for its accurate calls.

            "description": "Also: Bad and good results this earnings season, new tax rules, stock picks and how you too can be a mortgage lender.As part of the MarketWatch 50 series, Eleanor Laise interviewed Dr. Daniel Skovronsky, the chief scientific and medical officer at Eli Lilly & Co. LLY, -0.14%. The company\u2019s stock has soared 63% this year amid excitement for its Mounjaro treatment for Type 2 diabetes. This is a GLP-1 medication, competing with Wegovy and Ozempic, which are made by Novo Nordisk A/S NVO, +2.80%. This category of medicine leads to such dramatic weight loss that it could affect a number of other industries.During the interview, Skovronsky talked about a different path ahead for much less expensive weight-loss drugs. He also said he was \u201d extremely optimistic\u201d about Lilly\u2019s experimental treatment for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, which is going through clinical trials.More of the MarketWatch 50:Each quarterly earnings season features myriad headlines about companies whose results beat analysts\u2019 consensus estimates for sales and earnings. You can expect a roughly 70% \u201cbeat rate\u201d every quarter. Over the long term, a \u201cbeat and raise\u201d pattern, with consensus estimates rising following the earnings reports, can support rising stock prices.But there are always exceptions. A company might miss the expectations of analysts, even after lowering the bar with its previous guidance. Or a company might be forced to reduce its stated outlook because of operational difficulties or a changing market. Here are some examples from this week:Shares of Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. WBD, -2.84% plunged 19% on Wednesday after the company warned that it will not be able to pay down debt as quickly as it had planned if the TV advertising market doesn\u2019t recover. Another factor that may have upset investors was a 700,000 decline in direct-to-consumer subscriptions.Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav said during the company\u2019s earnings call that the subscription decline was tied to \u201cone of our lightest original-content schedules in years,\u201d partly resulting from the Hollywood actors strike, which ended Thursday. The company had $44.8 billion in total debt as of Sept. 30, down from $52.6 billion at the end of 2022. During the call, Zaslav said: \u201cWhile paying down debt and de-levering will remain a top priority for us, we\u2019re also now in a position to allocate more capital towards growth opportunities.\u201dWBD in its current form was created on April 8, 2022, when AT&T Inc.

Here\u2019s a chart for the combined company\u2019s stock price since that date:More examples of difficult earnings reports this week: There was a long period during which low interest rates helped support many initial public offerings, with shares often soaring on the first day of trading.

Earnings season has underscored the regrets among investors who jumped in early for several IPOs, including Arm Holdings PLC ARM, -2.77%, Klaviyo Inc. KVYO, -6.69% and Instacart CART, -3.59%. Investors were in a better mood after Walt Disney Co. DIS, -0.01% reported its third-quarter results, including a large increase in Disney+ streaming subscriptions. The company\u2019s stock rose 7% on Thursday for its best performance in almost three years, as analysts reacted positively to Disney CEO Bob Iger\u2019s cost-cutting initiatives and the increasing profitability with price increases.

Learn MoreApple's (AAPL 0.74%) stock has dipped about 7% since August, having posted four consecutive quarters of revenue declines. Investors have grown concerned amid dwindling product sales, which account for more than 70% of the company's revenue. Apple is being challenged by macroeconomic headwinds, which triggered reductions in consumer spending across the tech market.The iPhone manufacturer posted fiscal 2023 earnings on Nov. 2, revealing net sales decreased by 3% year over year. Revenue fell in Apple's four product categories, with services reporting the only growth during the 12 months. Apple has retained leading market share in multiple product categories despite recent hurdles. Meanwhile, its services business has continued to flourish, with the company still managing to hit over $99 billion in free cash flow. Alongside ventures into high-growth markets such as artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual/augmented reality, Apple remains an attractive long-term investment.Here's why buying the dip in this growth stock stock is a good idea right now.Apple's services segment includes income from the App Store and subscription-based platforms such as Apple TV+, Music, iCloud, and more. The digital business has become a particularly lucrative area for the company over the years and is now its second-highest earning segment after the iPhone.Services regularly hit profit margins above 70%, significantly higher than products' profit margins of 36%. Meanwhile, the segment is rapidly expanding and could eventually overtake the iPhone as Apple's most valuable division.Services posted revenue growth of 9% in 2023, with iPhone sales dipping 2% year over year. The difference follows a similar trend from the year before when services posted double the revenue growth of Apple's smartphone segment.Digital services have propped up Apple's business during recent challenges and proved less vulnerable to macroeconomic factors than products. The growth trajectory of services is positive as it will allow Apple to rely less on product sales over the long term, especially when economic headwinds arise.Moreover, one of Apple's biggest hurdles over the last year has been a decrease in customers upgrading their devices as inflation has spiked. However, services allow the company to keep profiting from old products as users continue to buy apps and subscribe to its various platforms.Apple has faced repeated declines this year. However, it appears to be playing the long game by expanding its services business and investing in alternative digital markets like artificial intelligence (AI).Apple's dominance in consumer tech has seen it achieve leading market shares in most of its product categories. The company's priority on quality, user-friendly design language, and an interconnected ecosystem have paved the way for nearly unrivaled brand loyalty from consumers. The public's preference for Apple's offerings has been especially prevalent during a recent economic downturn.According to Counterpoint Research, U.S. smartphone shipments decreased by 19% year over year in the third quarter of 2023. The declines sent Samsung and Alphabet sales plunging 26% and 37%, respectively. However, Apple's smartphone shipments fell a more moderate 11%, allowing it to retain its 55% market share.Data by YCharts.The popularity of Apple's products has saved it from the worst market declines, suggesting its command of the market remains an attractive reason to invest in its stock. The chart above shows how, despite recent hurdles, Apple delivered more stock growth over the last five years than any other company in what's considered the \"Big Five\" of tech.In the same period, Apple's annual revenue rose 47% and operating income close to 80%. The company isn't out of the woods yet and could continue to see product revenue decline into the start of 2024. However, its dominance in consumer tech means it could profit significantly once economic challenges subside. Meanwhile, its booming services business is on a lucrative growth track.While Apple's stock dip has been unfortunate for current investors, it has also lowered the price for new ones. The company's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio currently sits at 29, significantly lower than the same metric for competitors Amazon or Microsoft. As a result, Apple shares offer more value than both of these tech giants, thanks to its recent dip.Apple remains a powerful figure in tech, and I wouldn't bet against its long-term future.

Learn MoreJust because you're at the top doesn't mean you'll stay there long if you don't execute. For many years, Apple (AAPL 0.74%) held on to its claim as the world's largest company. However, thanks to declining sales (for four straight quarters), Apple's lead is slipping and Microsoft (MSFT 1.68%)is closing in.At the current rate, I wouldn't be surprised if it happened by 2025. So, is it time to hop off the Apple train and adopt a new bedrock stock for every new investor's portfolio? Let's find out.When discussing the world's largest company, I'm referring to its market cap, which is calculated by multiplying its share price by the number of shares outstanding. Essentially, it's how much money one would have to pay to own the company outright.MSFT Market Cap data by YCharts.While Apple maintained a fairly even spread throughout the past three years (besides a small period when Microsoft briefly overtook Apple), that gap has narrowed to under $150 billion. While that is a massive gap in its own right, it only represents a 5.3% gain in Microsoft's stock price or a 5% fall in Apple's.That amount of movement can easily happen in a week or a month, so why do I think it will be 2025 before Microsoft truly takes over the title? While Microsoft may momentarily accomplish this task, I'm not concerned about one- or two-week movements; I want to see permanent control of the world's largest company title.At the current rate, I think 2025 will be an easy-to-hit goal for Microsoft.The most recent set of quarterly results for this pair couldn't have been more different. Apple's revenue declined by 1%, while Microsoft's increased by 13%. This shouldn't come as a surprise as Apple's revenue streams are extremely consumer-facing. With the current state of the consumer plus housing prices soaring and inflation still taking a toll on wallets, Apple may struggle for a while.On the other hand, Microsoft's cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI) copilot, and other business solutions continue to grow rapidly. Microsoft is at the crossroads of two important business shifts: cloud computing and AI. As a result, its growth should remain healthy for some time. Even if the consumer regains their strength, it would be a large surprise for Apple's growth rate to be faster than Microsoft's.Because of this stark difference in each company's outlook, the stocks trade for different price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios.MSFT PE Ratio data by YCharts. PE Ratio = price-to-earnings ratio.Microsoft earned its premium to the market (the S&P 500 trades for 25 times earnings), although Apple hasn't recently. The stock is currently relying on past execution to vouch for its current state, which doesn't seem like a winning investment strategy.Microsoft has shown itself to be the better investment over the past year. With its exposure to key business trends, it should continue to put up strong growth and grow its earnings at a rapid pace. Apple will have to wait for the consumer to recover, taking the ball out of its court. Plus, with the smartphone renewal cycle elongating, Apple's business may struggle for a few years.As a result, I think Microsoft will take the torch of the world's largest company monetarily throughout 2023 and 2024 but secure it for good starting in 2025.Keithen Drury has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

            "title": "Stocks may struggle until Thanksgiving as bond yields bounce. And one sector in particular is a turkey.",
            "description": "A revival of bond yields halted the longest stock rally in two years, and now the market may struggle until Thanksgiving says Fundstrat's NewtonEarly Friday futures suggest stocks will steady after an eight-day winning streak hit the buffers in the previous session.A poorly-received 30-year U.S. government bond auction and a reminder from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell that the fight against inflation was not over did the damage, as bond yields moved sharply higher.Bulls had hoped that the recent swift 50 basis-point slide in benchmark Treasury yields from 16-year highs above 5%, would sustain a classic end- of-year rally. Before Thursday\u2019s sell-off, the S&P 500 had gained 6.45% in just those eight trading days.Yet, as Vanda Research notes, one market cohort was not particularly convinced by the early November charge. Retail investors showed some reluctance in chasing the risk-on mood, as the chart below tracking net retail buying and the SPDR S&P 500 exchange traded fund SPY shows:This phenomena is not uncommon, says Vanda, with retail investors often wary at the beginning of rallies that follow a period of widespread market weakness. \u201cWhile seasonality does not support the idea that retail investors will re-emerge in numbers into year-end, the extension of this \u2018pain rally\u2019 could see some momentum chasing by retail crowds before tax-loss selling will weigh on overall flows in late November and December,\u201d Vanda adds.And now, such reticence, combined with another jump in implied borrowing costs, means it\u2019s likely stocks may not look too clever in the next two weeks, says Mark Newton, head of technical strategy at Fundstrat.\u201cGiven that yields turned up sharply on poor auction results Thursday, it\u2019s likely that volatility is approaching for both equities and Treasuries and yields could lift into the Thanksgiving holiday,\u201d said Newton in a note published late Thursday.Technical factors during Thursday\u2019s dive highlighted the fragility of the recent rally, according to Newton. Similarly to recent days, big tech stocks initially disguised the struggles in other sectors, he notes, \u201cbut the large-cap weakness in healthcare XLV and consumer discretionary XLY into mid-day broadened out to additional weakness by day\u2019s end.\u201dTen out of 11 sectors fell in Thursday\u2019s session and market breadth \u2014 the number of gainers vs. decliners \u2014 finished with one stock rising for every three decliners.Furthermore, the S&P 500 closed near the lows of the day having presented a bearish engulfing candlestick pattern, Newton observes. Engulfing candlestick patterns may indicate a market reversal. The second candlestick will be much larger than the first, so that it completely covers or \u2018engulfs\u2019 the length of the previous bar.But it is the surge higher in bond yields that particularly concerns Newton. They appear to have bottomed and could very well move back up to the cycle highs around 5% for the 10-year note BX:TMUBMUSD10Y. \u201cCycles for Treasury yields show a possible short-term peak in December and more meaningful peak in late January/early February ahead of a large decline into next Summer 2024,\u201d says Newton.And one sector in particular in danger of such higher interest rates is Small-caps, as illustrated by the Russell 2000 index RUT. November, to date, marks the fourth consecutive month of Small-cap weakness relative to Large-cap, notes Newton, part of a larger intermediate-term downtrend which has been going on for nearly a decade.Some investors may be right in considering Small-caps have reached oversold levels, says Newton, but it\u2019s early to own this group for anyone with a timeframe of less than three months. \u201cI suspect that even further weakness happens into December ahead of a much-awaited bounce in the Russell 2000 and S&P Small-cap 600 index, both on an absolute and also relative basis.\u201dMore generally, Newton reckons that the stock market will pick after Thanksgiving, but he reiterates: \u201cSmall-caps should be avoided until proper evidence of a larger peak in Treasury yields.\u201dU.S. stock-index futures ES00, -0.17% YM00, -0.40% NQ00, -0.18% are mixed as benchmark Treasury yields BX:TMUBMUSD10Y inch higher.

Learn MoreThe S&P 500 has been in rally mode this year, and after a brief stumble, the upward trend has resumed. In the week ended Nov. 3, the widely followed index jumped nearly 6%, marking its best performance for any week so far this year.Helping fuel those gains has been excitement about the potential of artificial intelligence (AI). While some companies have been basking in the limelight of their AI ambitions, others have been quietly toiling away in the shadows, preferring to let the results of their efforts speak for themselves.The S&P 500 is now just 5% below its all-time high, and many believe it's poised to make a run for the record. Given the potential for additional gains, now is likely the best time to buy these AI stocks before the general market updraft and AI product revelations drive their shares higher.Image source: Getty Images.Of all the companies that have (purposely) avoided the AI spotlight this year, Apple (AAPL 0.74%) could well be the poster child. The iPhone maker has been hard at work in the realm of AI and -- in typical Apple fashion -- stayed out of the spotlight until it had something noteworthy to announce.While some pundits have suggested Apple has fallen behind in the race for AI, CEO Tim Cook dismissed that notion in the conference call following its earnings release, saying many of the company's biggest innovations \"would not be possible without AI.\" Cook was also quick to point out that not every AI-related feature is labeled as such. \"We label them as to what their consumer benefit is,\" Cook said. \"But the fundamental technology behind it is AI and machine learning.\"In fact, there were a number of new features introduced with iOS 17 that are good examples. These include Personal Voice, an accessibility feature that uses machine learning to recreate a person's voice; and Live Voicemail, which allows users to read a transcription of a voice mail in real time, giving them the option to pick up the call before it ends. Cook also pointed to potentially life-saving features on the Apple Watch and iPhone, such as fall and crash detection as well as electrocardiogram measurement capabilities.When asked specifically about generative AI, Cook was cagey as always, \"Obviously, we have work going on,\" he said, declining to offer specifics. \"You will see product advancements over time where those technologies are at the heart of them,\" he added.Cook isn't the only one bullish on Apple's potential to wring profits from AI. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives believes that by rolling out additional use cases to its more than 2 billion active devices, Apple could harness AI to add between $30 and $40 to Apple's share price, or roughly 20% upside compared to Monday's closing price -- and that's just from AI.Furthermore, Ives estimates that roughly 250 million of the 1.2 billion active iPhones haven't been upgraded in over four years.If Ives is right -- and I believe he is -- there's plenty of pent-up demand for the iPhone, which gives Apple a fertile field to plow over the next few years.Amazon (AMZN -0.70%) is another company that has avoided the AI spotlight, but that's mostly because the company has taken a different path with generative AI, integrating the technology into everything it does.When it comes to digital retail Amazon is without equal, representing approximately 38% of all e-commerce sales in the U.S. in 2022, more than the next 14 competitors combined, according to online data provider Statista. It makes sense, then, that e-commerce would be a primary focus of Amazon's efforts. The company developed generative AI tools that sellers can use to write product descriptions. It also layered generative AI into its recommendations to improve the relevance of its product reviews, making this treasure trove of data more useful to shoppers.Amazon Web Services (AWS) is also the undisputed leader in cloud infrastructure services, with 30% of the market, according to cloud data provider Canalys. AWS was also responsible for 16% of Amazon's revenue and 88% of its profits so far this year, which makes it another prime candidate for its efforts. This also puts the company in the enviable position to expand its lead by offering AI services to its cloud customers.Finally, the company recently announced the general release of Amazon Bedrock, a cloud service that allows AWS customers to select from a number of AI models it offers, while helping develop generative AI applications from scratch. The service can also integrate proprietary user data, which makes these apps even more useful.Yet for all this opportunity, Amazon is historically cheap, selling for just 2 times forward sales. This gives savvy investors the chance to buy shares for a song, before the market rally pushes Amazon stock even higher.John Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Learn MoreFor nearly six decades, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.54%) (BRK.B 0.59%) CEO Warren Buffett has been dazzling Wall Street and everyday investors with his investing prowess. Even with an occasional bad trade mixed in, the Oracle of Omaha has delivered an aggregate return of better than 4,300,000% for his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) spanning a little over 58 years.What's great about Buffett's success is his willingness to share his investment philosophy. His \"recipe\" often involves buying brand-name companies with sustained moats and trusted management teams, and hanging on these stakes for the long haul.Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.But what's commonly overlooked about Buffett's investment portfolio is his focus on dividend stocks and portfolio concentration. Even though the Oracle of Omaha and his investing lieutenants are overseeing a $343 billion portfolio that has stakes in over 50 securities, just a handful of these businesses account for the bulk of Berkshire's invested assets -- as well as its dividend income.Over the next year, Warren Buffett and his team are expected to oversee the collection of more than $6 billion in dividend income. However, nearly half of this amount ($2.83 billion) will come from just three stocks.The Berkshire Hathaway holding that's bringing home more proverbial bacon for Warren Buffett and his team than any other stock is Bank of America (BAC -0.69%), which is commonly referred to as \"BofA.\" The more than 1 billion shares of BofA held by Buffett's company are expected to produce north of $991 million in dividend income over the coming 12 months.There's, arguably, no industry the Oracle of Omaha is more knowledgeable about than banking. That's probably why Bank of America is Berkshire's second-largest holding by market cap.What makes bank stocks so special in Buffett's eyes is their ability to use time to their advantage. Even though financial stocks are cyclical and therefore exposed to higher loan losses and credit delinquencies during recessions, economic downturns tend to be short-lived. By comparison, the U.S. economy tends to expand for multiple years at a time, if not a full decade. Banks like BofA are able to take advantage of these long-winded periods of expansion by growing their loan portfolios and asset management segments.The factor that sets Bank of America apart from its peers is the company's interest rate sensitivity. Changes in interest rates will increase or lower BofA's net interest income more than any other large U.S. bank. With the Federal Reserve raising its federal funds rate at the fastest pace in four decades to tackle historically high inflation, Bank of America has been a prime beneficiary. This rate-hiking cycle has added billions in net interest income each quarter, and the Fed doesn't appear to be particularly close to lowering rates anytime soon.Credit should also be given to Bank of America's technology investments. As of the end of September 2023, just shy of three-quarters of its customers were banking online or via mobile app. Digital transactions and online loan sales are considerably less costly for banks than in-person or phone-based interactions. As consumers shift more of their banking to digital channels, BofA has the luxury of consolidating some of its branches and reducing its expenses.A second Warren Buffett stock that's generating an absolute boatload of annual dividend income is energy stock Occidental Petroleum (OXY -2.10%). Based on the more than 228 million shares of Occidental common stock owned by Berkshire Hathaway, the company's $0.72 base annual payout equates to about $164.2 million in annual income.However, Buffett's company also owns $10 billion worth of Occidental preferred stock that yields 8% annually. Berkshire received this preferred stock (along with warrants for common shares of Occidental) in exchange for handing over $10 billion that helped facilitate Occidental Petroleum's acquisition of Anadarko in 2019. Collectively, Berkshire is netting more than $964 million in annual income from Occidental.The core catalyst for this sizable investment is the expectation that the spot price for crude oil will rise. Fueling this thesis is multiple years of capital underinvestment by energy majors during the COVID-19 pandemic. When coupled with Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the uncertainty this invasion creates for Europe's energy supply needs, there's a strong possibility of global crude oil supply constraints for years to come. Tight supply should provide an upward lift on the spot price of crude oil.Despite being an integrated energy company that operates downstream chemical plants, Occidental derives most of its revenue from the drilling side of the equation. In other words, Occidental is something of a leveraged play among integrated operators, based on the spot price of crude oil. If the price rises, Occidental should disproportionately benefit relative to its peers. But if it declines, the opposite is true.The other thing that's noteworthy about this investment is that Occidental is carrying around quite a bit of net debt (nearly $19.7 billion). The Oracle of Omaha typically invests in businesses that have pristine balance sheets and plenty of financial flexibility. That isn't the case with Occidental. It'll require a sustained high spot price for crude oil to continue reducing its outstanding debt.Image source: Apple.The third Buffett stock that collectively, with Bank of America and Occidental Petroleum, accounts for nearly half of Berkshire Hathaway's annual dividend income is tech stock Apple (AAPL 0.74%).By itself, Apple represents more than 47% of Berkshire's $343 billion in invested assets. Perhaps it's no surprise that the nearly 915.6 million shares of Apple owned by the Oracle of Omaha's company are yielding almost $879 million in annual dividend income. Given Apple's mammoth operating cash flow, there's a good chance its base annual payout will head even higher over time.Apple's primary catalyst has long been its innovation. The advent of the iPhone has put Apple on the leading edge of smartphone innovation for more than a decade. Since introducing a 5G-capable version of the iPhone during the fourth quarter of 2020, Apple has maintained around half (if not more) of the U.S. smartphone market share.The next step in Apple's evolution is its ongoing development as a platforms company. CEO Tim Cook is spearheading this transition that emphasizes subscription services. The benefit of a subscription-driven segment is consistent operating cash flow, a higher long-term operating margin, and eventually less revenue volatility associated with major iPhone upgrade cycles.But the primary reason Warren Buffett is so infatuated with Apple, which he's referred to as \"better business than any we own,\" might be its capital-return program. On top of having the second-largest nominal-dollar dividend in the U.S., behind only Microsoft, Apple has repurchased more than $600 billion worth of its common stock since kicking off its buyback program 10 years ago. These repurchases are steadily increasing Berkshire's stake in Apple over time.Bank of America is an advertising partner of The Ascent, a Motley Fool company.

            "description": "The 2024 Honda CR-V Hybrid compact SUV boosts fuel economy and power over its regular combustion counterpart, while retaining all the other great qualities.The 2024 Honda CR-V Hybrid compact SUV boosts fuel economy and power over its regular combustion counterpart, while retaining all the other great qualities. Pricing starts at $33,350When we gave the current CR-V our Best Buy and Best Family Car awards, we meant all versions, including this hybrid variant. The CR-V is a superb, well-considered package. It does virtually everything right, including build quality, cabin space, safety, and easy-to-use tech. Offering lower fuel bills and more power than the all-gas CR-V, Honda HMC, +0.17% says about half of all CR-V buyers will choose this variant. The non-hybrid Honda CR-V is reviewed separately.The 2024 Honda CR-V Hybrid starts at $33,350. That\u2019s for the Sport trim with front-wheel drive. This version (and the mid-range Sport-L) offers the option of all-wheel drive for an extra $1,500. The Sport Touring trim tops the entire 2024 CR-V range, hybrid or otherwise, and comes with the most equipment \u2014 including all-wheel drive.Rivals like the Toyota TM, +0.38% RAV4 Hybrid, Hyundai Tucson Hybrid, and Kia 000270, +3.68% Sportage Hybrid are priced similarly to each other, typically a little below the CR-V Hybrid.These are manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail prices and don\u2019t include the $1,295 factory-to-dealer delivery fee (destination charge).Before buying a new CR-V Hybrid compact SUV, check the Kelley Blue Book Fair Purchase Price to know what you should be paying. The CR-V Hybrid enjoys above-average resale values, even a little better than the non-hybrid CR-V. Recouping more money when you sell or trade a vehicle can mean a bigger down payment and smaller monthly payments on your next one.Also see: The 2023 Kia Sorento vs. the Toyota RAV4: Which one is better?A new Sport-L trim joins the CR-V Hybrid lineup this year. It\u2019s slotted between the Sport and Sport Touring trims with features like leather seats, a memory driver\u2019s seat, a 9-inch infotainment system, and a wireless charging pad.The CR-V Hybrid is propelled by a 204-horsepower drivetrain harnessing energy from both a gasoline engine and an electric motor. This latter item adds that extra spark to make this hybrid model even more enjoyable than the combustion-only CR-V.Yes, enjoyment. Easy, effort-free driving has always been something of a CR-V trait in previous generations. It\u2019s still evident in this CR-V Hybrid, but we\u2019ve discovered an added dimension to this king of the suburban road \u2014 which is a bit of a surprise, albeit a pleasant one. There\u2019s a poise and agility to how the CR-V Hybrid drives, a perfect complement to this energetic drivetrain.Yet not at the expense of comfort. If there was a CR-V Hybrid in our driveway, we\u2019d look forward to every trip \u2014 even that one to the dentist. A satisfying driving experience doesn\u2019t come just from accelerating or zipping around corners. It\u2019s also in things like confident braking, great outward vision (helped by the wide windshield), and a quiet cabin. The CR-V Hybrid excels at this stuff.Hybrids have brake energy regeneration systems that sometimes result in an odd feel to the pedal. Not this one. Stopping power is precise and strong, with enough feedback so drivers can tell how much pressure to apply.A few years ago, we wouldn\u2019t have bothered to mention the presence of a shift lever for the automatic transmission. But with the rise of push-button gear selectors in many other vehicles, the conventional shifter in the CR-V Hybrid caught our attention. It\u2019s great, it works, and it feels intuitive.We\u2019ve spent hundreds of hours driving and evaluating the current collection of compact SUVs, including this Honda CR-V Hybrid.Read: The pros and cons of plug-in hybrids and your guide to buying oneBody Stabilizing Seats. That\u2019s what Honda calls the front seats in the CR-V Hybrid compact SUV. And there was us thinking that all car seats \u2014 with their cushions and side bolsters \u2014 were designed to stabilize the body sitting in them. Fancy terms notwithstanding, they\u2019re supportive and comfortable enough for long trips.The most affordable CR-V Hybrid is the Sport trim, equipped to a decent level. But it also has a 7-inch infotainment touchscreen, which seems a bit small these days. Even the Sport-L and Sport Touring\u2019s 9-inch touchscreen is relatively modest. Honda is kind enough to supply an actual volume knob, though.The sharp graphics and clean looks of the driver information display are a visual delight. And we think the black metal mesh strip running across the dashboard looks good. But we can also imagine an owner buying a small paint brush and keeping it in the glove compartment, just so they can clean out that mesh from time to time. Thank goodness kids of sticky-finger age have to sit in the back.Adults (with sticky hands or otherwise) will find plenty of space in that second row. With an impressive 41 inches of rear legroom, the CR-V\u2019s backseat is roomy enough for a 6-footer to be comfortable.Cargo space goes from \u201cmassive\u201d with the rear seats up, to \u201calmost twice as massive\u201d when they\u2019re folded down. Seriously. The figures are 39.3 and 76.5 cubic feet \u2014 yet another way this Honda beats most of the competition. And a low cargo floor eases the loading and unloading of heavier items.You might like:The 2024 Hyundai Tucson hybrid improves an already excellent compact SUVHybrid drivetrainNo-brainer, best of both worlds\u2026 however you want phrase it, the CR-V Hybrid doesn\u2019t have to sacrifice power for fuel economy or the other way around. It doesn\u2019t even have to compromise on cargo space.Apple CarPlay/Android AutoWhoever invented the way to integrate a phone and its apps into a car\u2019s infotainment system, we salute you. This is standard in both trims, but the top Sport Touring has wireless Apple AAPL, +0.69% CarPlay.Wireless chargingIt\u2019s great to go the whole wireless hog. The charging pad is in the center console of the Sport Touring trim.All-wheel driveOptional on the Sport trim, standard on the Sport Touring, all-wheel drive earns its keep in bad weather. Every CR-V Hybrid also has a Snow driving mode, where throttle and transmission settings help combat wheelspin.Hill descent controlA standard system with both front-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive versions of the CR-V Hybrid, hill descent control works between 2 mph and 12 mph, allowing the driver to concentrate on steering down a slippery slope while the vehicle takes care of the throttle, brakes, and transmission.Traffic jam assistAs long as it senses an attentive hand on the steering wheel, the CR-V Hybrid can pretty well drive itself through a variety of traffic situations up to 45 mph.A 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine and an electric motor work together to create a total of 204 horsepower. Honda doesn\u2019t quote any torque figure, but we know from driving the CR-V Hybrid that it\u2019s lively and responsive.This energy goes through an automatic transmission to drive either the front wheels (FWD, standard in the lowest Sport trim) or all-wheel drive (AWD, optional in Sport, standard in the top Sport Touring model).Honda recommends 87 octane gasoline or higher. The CR-V Hybrid isn\u2019t the class-leader in terms of fuel economy, but it\u2019s close.2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine/electric motor204 total system horsepowerEPA combined fuel economy (2023): 40 mpg with front-wheel drive (43 city, 36 highway), 37 mpg with all-wheel drive (40 city, 34 highway)Read about the non-hybrid CR-V: The 2024 Honda HR-V review: A roomy, refined subcompact SUV with generous safety tech and unbeatable valueAt 15,000 miles per year, a front-wheel-drive CR-V Hybrid will burn through about 10 fewer gallons per month than its gas-only counterpart. Even at $3 per gallon, that\u2019s $30 per month. Looking at a full 5-year buy/drive/sell ownership cycle, those savings would more than make up for the hybrid\u2019s relatively nominal price premium. The hybrid also requires about 10 fewer trips to the gas station every year.See: The 10 hybrid vehicles with the longest rangeThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) has not crash-tested the CR-V Hybrid specifically, but the regular CR-V has been named a Top Safety Pick+, the institute\u2019s highest accolade.Be sure to read: These are 2023\u2019s safest new carsThe CR-V Hybrid has a basic new-vehicle warranty of three years or 36,000 miles, whichever happens first. This is typical for mainstream companies like Honda. The powertrain is covered for five years or 60,000 miles, while the hybrid battery has a warranty of eight years or 100,000 miles. Again, all quite par for the course.

            "description": "While tracking short-term performance can highlight some weaknesses, it also brings up a lot of noise from the market.hanibaram/iStock via Getty Imageshanibaram/iStock via Getty ImagesOptimize your portfolio review! I'll grant you that a portfolio review isn't exciting, and can be tedious really, but if we skip it, we're unaware of key events and information. We end up with rock-bottom stock prices and dividend cuts taking us completely by surprise!I cannot stress enough that you should never make a trade based solely on short-term performance. While the past two years have been frustrating, don't deviate from your investment process.You probably have losers, in your portfolio. Does that mean you should sell them? Absolutely not. Should you ignore your losers? Absolutely not. The proof is in the pudding. You need several ingredients to make a delicious pudding. If your core recipe is a proven success, you can live with a bit too much sugar or salt.While tracking short-term performance can highlight some weaknesses, it also brings up a lot of noise from the market. Over the past two years, we've had to deal with supply chain disruptions, inflation, rising interest rates, and a war. That's enough to create a lot of noise and much uncertainty.Our latest quarterly portfolio review at DSR had very little to do with the current state of the market. All changes resulted from examining macroeconomic trends, reviewing the quarterly results, and reviewing the overall portfolio. This quarter was all about rebalancing our positions.You're the one who knows how much risk you can tolerate and how you feel when you see a $5,000, $10,000, or $50,000 drop in value. You're the one who knows if you need that money in three months or in 30 years, and how you sleep at night when you think about your portfolio. That's why doing your due diligence and reviewing your portfolio regularly is so important: personal finance is, well... personal.To help you, here are the things I look at, in order, during my review.In general, asset allocation (the split of investments between equities, ETFs, Bonds, etc.) explains about 90% of the variability of a portfolio's returns over time (research conducted by Ibbotson & Kaplan). Notice I didn't write \"investment returns\", but rather \"variability\". When you review your portfolio, asset allocation (and sector allocation to a lesser extent), explains most fluctuations you observe. As fluctuations are the results of short-term movements, being exposed to an asset class or a sector (or not) explains the ups and downs of your portfolio.Within equity investments, for example, someone heavily concentrated in technology stocks, consumer discretionary, and REITs did terribly in 2022. In contrast, an investor focused on energy stocks feels that 2022 was a great year. Different allocations lead to different results.To avoid major volatility, I aim to keep my favorite sectors close to 20% of my portfolio and not exceed this limit. I like my portfolio to include at least 7-8 sectors. This ensures that I'm rarely overexposed and that I can ride multiple tailwinds.Similarly, I don't want my returns to depend on a couple of heavyweight stocks in my portfolio. I've had to sell shares of Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) to keep my exposure to a maximum of 15% for a stock; none of my holdings are that heavy now.In our DSR portfolios, we try to keep most holdings equally weighted. However, since we manage the portfolio as a real person would, we don't equally balance stocks every quarter; who has the patience to make that many trades in real life? But, when a stock becomes overweight, we'll trim a percentage and reallocate the money accordingly.As you see above, Broadcom (AVGO) was too heavy in our 100 USD portfolio. While all the other positions are between 5% and 6%, AVGO was close to 11%. Considering the stock surged, I'm not surprised at having to trim our position!When satisfied with the weight of each sector and stock, it's time to look at each stock individually. Most often, a simple look at their dividend triangle and latest quarterly earnings summary (and ratings in DSR, for members) is sufficient.Why? Because business models don't change overnight; Starbucks won't stop selling coffee tomorrow nor will the Canadian National Railway stop operating railroads. An in-depth analysis isn't required each time you review your portfolio. Our team of analysts helps DSR members by highlighting major changes in a company or in an industry.When a company shows a trend of slowing, or worse, absent, revenue growth, EPS growth, and dividend growth, (and has weak ratings in DSR), I look at the list of replacement stocks I keep on hand. This helps my chances of picking the best replacement security for my portfolio.I complete my review by looking at the portfolio and stock performance. The goal is to quickly identify anything that might be off. I don't mind my portfolio being down 10% if the overall market moved in a similar way. If my portfolio is down 10% and the market is up 8%, then I must identify the source of this underperformance.Whether I underperform or overperform, it doesn't mean I'll make trades, but rather that I'll investigate to understand why it's happening.DSR PRO Report showing yield and year-to-date total return of a stockDSR PRO Report showing yield and year-to-date total return of a stockUsing the Pareto Principle, you can focus on the 20% that generates 80% of your returns. In most cases, no changes are necessary. But failing to monitor your investments could lead to surprise dividend cuts and potential disaster.None of us can completely avoid mistakes. However, by following a diligent portfolio review process, I can ensure I'm well-invested across various sectors and various quality stocks. Therefore, if I make a mistake, its impact is minor.Many times, I barely touched my portfolio and the DSR portfolios during reviews. The idea is to keep holdings as long as possible to benefit from the power of dividend growth and compounding interest. However, if we notice that many of our positions are either overweight or underweight, as was the case in our last review, we adjust the weighting.The aim is to sell high and buy low. We trim the outperformers and buy some more of the underperformers that are solid companies. The theme here is \"rebalancing\".Original PostEditor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors. This article was written by",

AAPL, +0.69%, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +1.56%, Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, +1.65%, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -0.57%, Nvidia Corp. NVDA, +0.45%, Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. META, +0.07% and Tesla Inc. TSLA, -4.27%, appear in the top holdings of both the value and growth ETFs.The largest three weights for the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Value ETF were Microsoft, Meta and Amazon as of Nov. 8, according to a list of the fund\u2019s top holdings on State Street\u2019s website. The ETF\u2019s next largest holdings were Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.B, +0.60% JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM, +0.49%, Walmart Inc. WMT, -8.36% and Cisco Systems Inc. CSCO, -11.63% The SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Growth ETF\u2019s top 10 holdings on Nov. 8 included all the Big Tech stocks except Meta, data on State Street\u2019s website show.Rising yields in the U.S. Treasury market in recent months hurt stocks, with the S&P 500\u2019s three straight months of declines through October paring its 2023 gains. So far in November, though, Treasury yields have retreated and the S&P 500 has climbed. Bond market yield moves have had an \u201cexaggerated\u201d impact on the U.S. stock market, said Arone.The S&P 500 closed Wednesday with an eighth straight day of gains that marked its longest winning streak since November 2021, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The index SPX finished lower Thursday though to snap that stretch of gains as Treasury bond yields rose. The bond market is volatile this year as the Federal Reserve keeps its benchmark interest rate elevated, after slowing its aggressive pace of hikes aimed at bringing down inflation to its 2% target. The market is anticipating that the combination of the Fed potentially concluding its hiking cycle, falling inflation and a slowing economy will put downward pressure on rates, said Arone. Rising yields this year have led to steep losses in long-term Treasurys, with investors questioning whether now may be a good time to buy them.The Vanguard Long-Term Treasury ETF VGLT was down 12.5% on a total return basis through October, but as yields declined this month the fund trimmed its year-to-date losses to 8.5% as of Thursday afternoon, according to FactSet data. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.Investors have been trying to discern how long the Fed might keep rates elevated and then eventually begin cutting rates, on the expectation that such a shift in monetary policy would spur a price rally in long-term bonds. Fed-funds futures points to traders anticipating the Fed may start lowering its benchmark rate in 2024, the CME FedWatch Tool shows. Arone said one risk to his view that small-cap and value equities could drive a broadening in the stock-market rally is a deeper recession than he is now anticipating. A rise in real interest rates is another risk, he said.See: Fed maintains freeze on interest rates as it fine-tunes fight against inflationShort-term Treasury maturities remain the most attractive part of the yield curve with low volatility, but investors may also consider moving into intermediate-term investment-grade corporate credit in order to capture any rally from potential Fed rate cuts, according to Arone. He said that strategy could involve holding the SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF BIL as well as the SPDR Portfolio Intermediate Term Corporate Bond ETF SPIB. Ultra-short-term T-bills are still \u201ca good idea,\u201d but taking on \u201ca little bit\u201d of credit risk may set investors up to benefit from price appreciation should the Fed finish tightening its policy and rates fall, according to Arone. The SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF returned a total 4.2% this year as of Thursday afternoon, compared with a 1.8% total return for the SPDR Portfolio Intermediate Term Corporate Bond ETF over the same period, FactSet data show.

            "title": "Billionaire 'Bond King' Says Sell These Charlie Munger Must-Buy Stocks: Our Approach",
            "description": "Learn about Charlie Munger's recommended stocks, Jeffrey Gundlach's warning about their performance in a recession, and our approach. Click for more of our picks.Matt WinkelmeyerMatt WinkelmeyerBillionaire investor Jeffrey Gundlach - commonly referred to as the \"Bond King\" - recently urged investors to dump stocks that Charlie Munger just said investors need to own to \"get ahead.\" In this article, we will compare the contrasting advice offered by these two legendary investors and share our approach.Mr. Munger of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.A, BRK.B) fame recently told The Wall Street Journal that investors should buy at least some of the leading mega-cap stocks (often referred to as \"The Magnificent Seven\" for their stellar recent stock market performance) in order to \"get ahead.\" Here are his comments:I think that the modern investor, to get ahead, almost has to get in a few stocks that are way above average\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 They try and have a few Apples or Googles or so on, just to keep up, because they know that a significant percentage of all the gains that come to all the common stockholders combined is going to come from a few of these super competitors.In addition to these comments, Mr. Munger essentially reiterated this view in a recent podcast interview, stating:Everybody needs some significant participation in the 12 companies that do better than everybody else and you need two or three of them at least, and if you have that mindset, Apple is a logical candidate to be on the list.These leading stocks dominate the top holdings lists in the S&P 500 (SPY, VOO) and Nasdaq (QQQ) indexes and include Apple Inc. (AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (META), and Tesla, Inc. (TSLA).Mr. Munger's perspective is unsurprising given that Berkshire Hathaway has a massive stake in AAPL and a smaller one in AMZN. Moreover, Mr. Munger has made numerous other investments in very large, leading companies over the years that have mostly generated phenomenal returns for him over the long term (with his failed investment in Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA) being a notable exception).Charlie Munger's encouragement to buy some of these market-leading stocks as a core position in an investment portfolio indicates that he believes that owning companies with exceptionally durable and powerful competitive advantages is one of the most straightforward paths to successfully compounding one's wealth over the long term, even if it means paying a premium valuation for those stocks up front. While some investors emphasize value and others emphasize growth, Mr. Munger appears to emphasize quality above all else.That being said, fellow billionaire and legendary investor Jeffrey Gundlach is taking a position on these leading stocks that is diametrically opposed to Munger's, stating recently of the Magnificent Seven:They will obviously be the worst performers in the upcoming recession. Whatever is leading the charge going into the economic downturn invariably must lead the charge on the way down. I would get out of them.Mr. Gundlach is clearly referring to the fact that the Magnificent Seven have massively outperformed the market for years and have held up spectacularly well in the face of rising interest rates. As a result, he believes that - from a valuation perspective - they also have the farthest to fall should the economy and the broader markets falter.This also makes sense as price is what you pay, and value is what you get when investing. While these market leaders may generate very high-quality earnings and have stellar balance sheets and very durable competitive advantages, if the combination of your earnings yield and growth rate are too low relative to where interest rates are, your total return on your investment is unlikely to be very impressive.Moreover, the \"Bond King\" is likely also incorporating the fact that a big reason why these mega-cap technology stocks have performed so well this year is due to the ongoing AI boom, from which they are expected to benefit immensely. Clear evidence of this is the fact that NVDA - the company that is most likely to benefit from AI growth among the Magnificent Seven - is also by far the top performer of the group year-to-date. Moreover, other AI companies like Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) have also had a very impressive year-to-date performance. As a result, it stands to reason that general market bullishness on AI is driving up the entire group of mega-cap technology stocks, and once this bullish sentiment begins to fade in the face of a recession, so too will the frothy valuations on these stocks.Data by YChartsWe see merits in both investors' approaches and we do not think they are necessarily mutually exclusive, as Mr. Munger's perspective is clearly long-term oriented and is not concerned about short-term macroeconomic movements. Munger and Buffett are famous for not being short-term macroeconomic investors and instead focusing on long-term trends at the company and industry level.Meanwhile, Mr. Gundlach's analysis was based entirely on his expectation of a recession hitting in the next year, so it is therefore coming from a very different perspective than Munger's.As for us, we tend to take a blended approach to these two philosophies. We pick each of our positions based on a company-level qualitative and quantitative analysis and invest on a value basis with a fairly long-term outlook. However, we also tend to lean our portfolio in the direction that we deem to be prudent based on our general macroeconomic outlook.For example, we currently expect the economy to go into recession sometime in the next 3-12 months and also believe that interest rates are at or near their peak levels for this cycle. As a result, while we remain somewhat diversified and are also focused on picking undervalued individual companies that are of good to great quality, we are currently overweighting defensive businesses that have been beaten down by rising interest rates and should rebound sharply as interest rates recede moving forward. In particular, we like utilities (XLU) and other infrastructure companies like Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. (BIP, BIPC), triple net lease and other defensive REITs like Realty Income Corporation (O), certain bonds and other fixed income instruments (BND), and precious metals (GLD, SLV, GDX).Part of what makes investing so challenging is that there is no standard playbook for making investment decisions and the world's greatest investors are constantly disagreeing with each other on what is the best course of action.For us, we have found that sticking to what we know is true as our core foundation for decision-making (i.e., sufficient but not excessive portfolio diversification, insisting on quality, buying low and selling high, remaining calm during market crashes and letting the dividends flow, and weighting a portfolio in the direction of where it appears the economy is headed all enhance risk-adjusted returns) helps simplify our investment process and has delivered significant outperformance over the three years that our portfolio has been active.In the case of comparing the latest Charlie Munger and Jeffrey Gundlach opinions on the Magnificent Seven, we tend to agree with Mr. Gundlach that now is not an opportune time to buy these stocks - and we actually own none of them given that we see greater opportunity elsewhere - but we also agree with Mr. Munger's perspective that owning these stocks for the long-term will likely still deliver decent or even very good total returns for investors as their competitive advantages and ability to leverage the exponential growth in AI and related technologies to enhance and grow their businesses will likely justify at least some of their current valuation premiums.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less.

            "title": "Hedge-fund founder talks flying taxis and stocks to own in a market facing a struggle",
            "description": "Charles Lemonides, founder of the hedge fund ValueWorks, has some stock ideas for a thorny market to come.The S&P 500 is set to squeak by with another winning session, maybe. Watch for comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to come and another Treasury bond auction to see if anything gets in the way of that.We\u2019re working toward that time of year when Wall Street wizards start rolling out equity forecasts for the year to come. Based on where the S&P 500 SPX stood on Wednesday, less than half are going to be right, though they\u2019ve got nine weeks to turn things around.Our call of the day comes from the founder of the long-biased hedge fund ValueWorks, Charles Lemonides, who expects stocks to struggle \u201cfor the next number of quarters at the very least,\u201d having been in the grips of a bear-market rally this year. Not that such a set-up scares Lemonides, who manages $300 million at ValueWorks. \u201cIf you can identify really good assets, and you can find them at 50 cents on the dollar, that\u2019s going to work out well over time,\u201d he told MarketWatch in a recent interview. \u201cBecause we\u2019ve been in this challenged environment for so long, the number of those things that are really mispriced is large, and the ability to look through them, and find the best among them, is great.\u201dThe manager hedges his bets with varied picks \u2014 \u201csecurity-specific and very distinct [from] one another.\u201d One of his favorite stocks right now is small-cap holding Hyster-Yale Materials HY, -0.02%, a lift-truck and after-market parts maker, that he says is anything but small, with \u201c$5 billion\u2013ish in sales,\u201d though it trades at three times peak earnings. His view on Hyster-Yale is that \u201cvaluation is going to support today\u2019s price, regardless,\u201d and for that same reason he owns chip maker Qualcomm QCOM, -0.22% and banking heavyweight Goldman Sachs GS, -0.55%. Lemonides also owns a \u201chandful\u201d of senior debt securities in retail and banking \u2014 that\u2019s the least risky kind of debt to own because the company must repay that money first if it goes bankrupt. He notes the yields on those became \u201cvery, very compelling, and it\u2019s not that we want to buy the yield \u2026 but we think the yield will go back down to the 8% range and we get a 50% capital gain on the preferred stock.\u201dHe\u2019s also invested in Joby Aviation JOBY, -2.12%, which delivered its first electric air taxi to the U.S. Air Force in September. \u201cThat could be a very exciting long-term growth story and \u2026 you\u2019re buying it for significantly less than they\u2019ve invested in developing their aircraft over the past 10 years,\u201d he said, adding that Joby is showing up as the leader in its field.Making money on this comes down to \u201cbeing able to discern which of these are real and which of them are fake and which of them will survive and which have been ones where the economic story has been real and where it\u2019s not,\u201d he said. \u201cSo even if we think the market will be facing a headwind over the next six to nine months, some of these names are going to hold up just fine, and some of them are making money in the near term,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if it turns out that this is the beginning of a new bull market, these things will all rally by 15% to 25% in six months.\u201dOn the other side of the hedging equation, he\u2019s poised to profit via short positions in \u201ca wide array of different companies.\u201d Among those is aircraft-parts maker TransDigm TDG, -1.18%, which he notes has a \u201cvery significant debt load, is very levered and trades 10 times sales enterprise value,\u201d a metric that compares the total value of the company with its sales. The valuation is simply out of whack, he says. (TransDigm just announced a deal to buy an aerospace parts maker for $1.4 billion.)Lemonides has a short position in revenue-cycle management group R1RCM RCM, -0.75%, which does billing for hospital chains. He sees trouble ahead in the next year, noting its share price has lost ground in the past two. \u201cThey\u2019re not really at scale \u2014 they\u2019re small and have been built through acquisitions, and so there\u2019s a decent amount of debt outstanding, and the basic business has been challenged over the past couple of years.\u201d And he thinks Envestnet ENV, -1.84%, currently at $37 per share, is headed for $20. The fintech, which earns fees by getting in the middle of the money-management business, was a market darling for seven years but has been hitting fresh lows, he says. Its operating results have stalled in the past two years along with markets, meaning they\u2019ve likely burned through a \u201csignificant\u201d pile of cash and, given hefty management turnover, will \u201csuffer in a tough market environment,\u201d said Lemonides.He\u2019s also got a short position on Mister Car Wash MCW, -2.14%, which has \u201cleveled up car washes across the country\u201d and whose \u201cspecial sauce\u201d is all about getting people to pay for subscriptions and clean vehicles more often.\u201cIt\u2019s a fine idea, but we don\u2019t think it\u2019s a $2 billion idea. And the growth on the company has all happened because they bought car washes and sold the properties then leased them out, and that is going to wash out,\u201d he said. That brings him to another reason to short those stocks \u2014 that investors running out of patience near year-end with companies whose share prices have dropped sharply over the past two years.\u201cIf you paid $30 a share for Mister Car Wash and it\u2019s $5, the tax loss is worth more to you half the time than any upside in the stock. And so we think a lot of these will come under tax-law selling pressure coming into the middle of December,\u201d said Lemonides.

Learn MoreUnlike the Android smartphone market that's starting to bottom out, Apple (AAPL 0.74%) products are still in a bit of a downturn. Sure, the iPhone 15 looks like a hit, and MacBook demand is bottoming, but other products are still coming off of peak sales levels in 2022 as consumer spending cools.That's having an outsized effect on Apple suppliers, and especially wireless connectivity chip specialist Skyworks Solutions (SWKS -1.15%). The stock keeps falling and by some metrics looks dirt cheap, but there might be better ways to play the next bull market for mobile technology.Apple reported a modest year-over-year uptick in iPhone revenue (up 2.8%) during its final quarter of fiscal 2023 (the three months ended in September), ending a not-so-great year for Apple's bread-and-butter product. To kick off fiscal 2024, management said the iPhone 15 is a hit, and momentum will continue through its next quarter (the three months ending in December 2023). MacBook revenue, which just fell 34% year over year in the last quarter, is also expected to begin a rebound. This will no doubt be helped by the recent surprise announcement of new MacBooks powered by the M3 chip. The problem is, Apple product sales overall fell in fiscal 2023, and especially so in non-iPhone revenue. Apple has a large software and services segment that can help offset the pain. Nevertheless, the falling hardware sales had a big impact on Skyworks Solutions, which still counts nearly 70% of its sales from Apple. Apple Product SegmentFiscal 2023 Revenue YOY Increase (Decrease)iPhone$200.6 billion(2.4%)Mac$29.4 billion(27%)iPad$28.3 billion(3.4%)Wearables, home, and accessories$39.8 billion(3.4%)Services$85.2 billion9.1%Data source: Apple. YOY = year over year. Skyworks Solutions MetricFiscal 2023YOY Increase (Decrease)Revenue$4.77 billion(13%)Earnings per share$6.13(22%)Free cash flow$1.65 billion76%Data source: Skyworks Solutions. The lone positive in the above report from Skyworks is the free-cash-flow (FCF) print, which made a recovery from depressed levels in 2022 (when the downturn for chips tied to consumer markets began) to an FCF profit margin of nearly 35% in the last year. That's a similar dynamic that worked in the favor of fellow mobile chipmaker Qualcomm as well.The good news is that Skyworks management believes an FCF margin of over 30% is sustainable, too.The bad news, though, is that Skyworks' business outside of smartphones (including mostly iPhone, but some Android and other non-smartphone sales, too) will remain in decline. Skyworks' guidance for the final three months of calendar year 2023 (like Apple, the first quarter of fiscal 2024) implies revenue will be down 6% from a year ago at the midpoint.What's really frustrating is that Skyworks is still joined at the hip to Apple and the now sluggish smartphone market overall, while other companies (again, like Qualcomm) have made far more robust headway in places like automotive technology. It's not for lack of trying. Remember, Skyworks made that big automotive and infrastructure acquisition from Silicon Laboratories over two years ago, and it's still not having the big impact on the business's transformation like what was expected.At any rate, by some metrics, Skyworks stock looks really cheap at just under 15 times trailing-12-month earnings and less than 9 times FCF. But the market hasn't been impressed with the lack of guidance for a more pronounced upswing in sales activity for this chipmaker. I sold my shares in Skyworks a few months ago, and at this point, the company still appears to be taking it on the chin from Apple's overall lackluster product sales growth.

Learn MoreThere are thousands of tech stocks for investors to choose from, but most tend to focus on just a handful of names. That's understandable to some degree since companies like Apple, Microsoft and Meta Platforms generate huge profits from their global customer bases.The good news is that stepping just outside of that small bubble of popular tech stocks can yield excellent diversification and some attractive values. Let's look at a few of these unsung heroes that are worth placing on your investing watchlist.If you like Apple for its tech innovation, then consider owning its less-celebrated rival Garmin (GRMN 0.24%). The GPS device giant recently posted impressive earnings results, with Q3 sales rising 12% to $1.3 billion. Assisting in that boost was growth in four of Garmin's five main product categories that span smartwatches and fitness trackers along with more complicated marine and aviation platforms. \"We delivered outstanding performance in the third quarter,\" Chief Executive Officer Cliff Pemble told investors in early November .Garmin's finances are outstanding, too. Cash flow is solidly positive and profit margin is holding above 20% of sales, not far from the peak that investors saw of roughly 25% of sales during the pandemic.Garmin is planning to press its advantage on innovation across its GPS device niches with a packed calendar of new releases in the coming years. Investors can review a long track record of wins on this score when judging the company's prospects. Looking further out, shareholders can expect to benefit from Garmin's success at boosting sales and profit margins into 2024 and beyond.You might be turned off by Microsoft's $2.7 trillion market valuation, a reflection of its dominant presence in several huge software niches. If that describes you, consider Palo Alto Networks (PANW -5.74%) as a way to gain focused exposure to the cybersecurity industry .Palo Alto Networks reported a blazing 18% sales spike for the selling period that ran through late July. Revenue was lifted by demand for more comprehensive cybersecurity solutions and for the company's unique platform that incorporates loads of artificial intelligence (AI) tech. This niche is proving resilient even as IT managers scale back on spending in other areas, and that factor is helping propel Palo Alto Networks' forward.As in the case of Garmin, there's a lot to like about this company's financial performance as well. Palo Alto Networks reported positive earnings last year and management is determined to build on those successes in fiscal 2024 and beyond. Adjusted income -- meaning not based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) -- should rise by about 20% this year, the company estimates, as free cash flow lands at nearly 40% of sales.Sure, it will be many years before Palo Alto can achieve anything approaching the over 40% of sales profit margin that Microsoft routinely generates. But the software-as-a-service specialist has a good shot at lifting margins into the double-digit percentages, potentially by 2025. That's a growth story that many shareholders will enjoy watching as the cybersecurity industry continues expanding in the coming years.Randi Zuckerberg, a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Learn MoreAre you worried about your finances, and whether you'll be able to retire? You're not alone: Many Americans are growing concerned about the rising cost of living and what the future will hold.One way you can improve your financial situation in the years ahead, however, is by putting money into dividend stocks, which can be a source of recurring income for you now and later in life. Three pillars that are excellent investments to buy and hold for decades are Realty Income (O 0.90%), Coca-Cola (KO -0.32%), and Bank of America (BAC -0.69%).A real estate investment trust (REIT) can make for a great dividend stock. As long as it has strong tenants and a promising outlook, it can potentially be a pillar to build your portfolio around.What is attractive about Realty Income is its diversification. Its portfolio has more than 1,300 clients spanning 85 industries. Its largest clients include many big retailers such as Dollar General, Walgreens Boots Alliance, and Dollar Tree. But none of those tenants account for even 4% of Realty Income's portfolio. One of the most attractive features of the stock is its high yield of 6% -- that's more than three times the S&P 500 average of 1.6%.Another great reason to own the stock is that it pays dividends monthly. Most dividend stocks make payments every quarter, but Realty Income provides a much more consistent stream of payouts. The REIT has an impressive streak of paying dividends for 640 consecutive months -- that's more than 53 years.With plenty of stability and profit margins often at 20% or wider, Realty Income is one of the safest high-yielding stocks for your portfolio right now.Coca-Cola is also known for its long-term stability, making it another excellent investment to build your portfolio around. Its dividend yield of 3.2% is above average, and the company has increased it consistently over the years.In the past decade, it has raised its quarterly payouts by 64%, from $0.28 to $0.46. That averages out to a compound annual growth rate of just over 5%. It has increased its payout annually for more than 60 consecutive years. Future dividend payments are never a guarantee, but it would be downright shocking for Coca-Cola to interrupt its impressive streak.The company's resiliency is on full display this year as net sales are up 6% through the first nine months of 2023. While that is largely due to price increases and could slow next year, it's a great example of Coke's pricing power. It can raise prices and pass on rising costs to consumers and still not suffer a huge decline in demand.With one of the best brands in the world, Coca-Cola can be a great investment to hold for decades and help strengthen your financial position.Bank of America is a top bank stock, yielding 3.4%. It's one of the safer bank stocks, and billionaire investor Warren Buffett has stuck with it. While he has sold off other bank stocks, Bank of America accounts for 8.5% of all holdings in Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway portfolio -- second only to Apple, which makes up 47.5% of Berkshire's holdings. Coca-Cola is a bit lower at 6.6% of the Berkshire portfolio.Investing in a top bank stock such as Bank of America is a good way to bet on the country, which Buffett always encourages people to do. As long as the economy is doing well, one of the nation's largest banks should, too.Over the trailing 12 months, Bank of America has reported nearly $29 billion in profit, which is just under 29% of its total revenue during that stretch ($101.2 billion). There's always the risk that if the economy deteriorates, the bank may reduce its dividend payments, as it did during the Great Recession. But as the economy inevitably improves, the dividend will recover, as it has during the past decade.Trading below its book value, Bank of America is a good stock to load up on right now. Even though investors might be concerned about the economy in the short term, in the long run, this is still a fantastic business to own a piece of.Bank of America is an advertising partner of The Ascent, a Motley Fool company.

Learn MoreBillionaire investor Warren Buffett knows how to pick winners in the stock market. And there's no big secret about the types of companies he likes to invest in. He values consistency, profitability, and companies whose futures remain bright.The top five holdings in Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK.A 0.54%) (BRK.B 0.59%) stock portfolio today are Apple (AAPL 0.74%), Bank of America (BAC -0.69%), American Express (AXP -0.71%), Coca-Cola (KO -0.32%), and Chevron (CVX -1.97%). All five of these stocks have the following three things in common:Warren Buffett is a value investor at heart, and one thing that's always going to be crucial to him is a company's prospects for profitability. All five of these businesses should be able to consistently report profits. Over the past year, their margins have all been comfortably above 10%.AAPL Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YCharts.These margins can and will fluctuate, however. Chevron and other oil and natural gas companies have struggled at times in the past due to low oil prices -- and the price of crude even briefly turned negative during the early stages of the pandemic. But that was an anomaly. Under normal conditions, Chevron runs a business that should be profitable.Bank of America offers the highest margin of these five businesses, but it, too, could struggle if a recession occurs and there is a slowdown in economic activity. It isn't immune to the effects of a downturn.Downturns can impact any business, but the key takeaway here is that in the long run and over the course of regular operating activities, investors should expect these businesses to post profits. That is a key criterion Buffett uses when selecting stocks.Another feature that's common to all these companies is that they have strong brands that consumers are familiar with.Buffett loves dividends. Receiving recurring income is an excellent way for investors to pad their overall gains from an investment. While some of these stocks have relatively low yields at the moment, it's likely all five were purchased by Berkshire at times when their yields were above average. Getting above-average yields isn't too hard when the S&P 500 average is 1.6%. All of these companies have also been relatively consistent in increasing their payouts in recent years:AAPL Dividend data by YCharts.It's OK to be a little greedy when it comes to dividends, as long as the underlying businesses are sound. And growing payouts can help offset the effects of inflation.Picking stocks can be as simple or complicated as investors want the process to be. For long-term value investors, it doesn't need to be difficult. Finding businesses that are profitable and pay dividends can be achieved by using a stock screener. There is a bit of judgment involved in assessing the strength of a brand, however. But consumers can gauge the strength of that, too, by assessing how popular a business is and how devoted and loyal its customers are.Berkshire Hathaway's top five stock portfolio holdings should serve as a reminder that investors don't need to go to great lengths searching for the next big stock.

            "description": "Big-cap tech and large-cap growth stocks continue to outperform, and we expect them to lead in the future. Click here for a detailed analysis.Kameleon007Kameleon007By Brian Nelson, CFAThe past couple of weeks have been met by buying pressure that the markets haven't seen in some time. Some are attributing it to many investment houses being wrongly positioned and having to make moves on the fly to correct to a higher weighting in equities. Some have pointed to dovish Fed commentary and the 10-year Treasury rate falling under 4.6% as a relief to all the bear cases pointing to the U.S. sovereign debt load. Others say it's a strong technical bounce off the downtrend in major averages. Still, others say it was a relatively strong third-quarter earnings season, which suggests a recession in the U.S. may still be far off. Whatever the combination of reasons for the rally the past two weeks, it has been most welcome and ran counter to the view that a washout may be nigh.The stylistic area of large cap growth is breaking out of its near-term downtrend. (TradingView)The stylistic area of large cap growth is breaking out of its near-term downtrend. (TradingView)Fundamental investors have been well-rewarded, too. Those that have focused on the cash-based sources of intrinsic value -- net cash on the balance sheet and future expectations of free cash flow -- have had tremendous exposure to big cap tech and the stylistic area of large cap growth (SCHG) during 2023, and these two areas have led, and we expect them to continue to lead. Back in July, we highlighted 5 stocks for a new bull market in this article, and we're reiterating that view today. Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Visa (V), and Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) all have excellent financials. We remain humble and so thankful for the past two weeks, and it has reinforced our view that big cap tech and the stylistic area of large cap growth remain the places to be.It is our view that stock prices and returns are in part a function of net cash on the balance sheet and future expectations of free cash flow. If future expectations of free cash flow increase, so should the stock price, all else equal. If future expectations of free cash flow decline, so should the stock price, all else equal. Investing is never this easy, of course, because there are always moving parts and confounding variables, but focusing on the key components of the discounted cash-flow model has always served investors well, or at least kept them out of trouble. Net cash on the balance sheet is a direct add-back to the sum of future expectations of free cash flow in arriving at an intrinsic value estimate, and we love companies that have this balance sheet component of intrinsic value, which offers so much optionality going forward, too.Most areas outside of big cap tech and large cap growth often fall short. Consumer staples (XLP), equity REITs (VNQ) and utilities (XLU) suffer from large net debt positions that hinder their equity values. Many industrials suffer from cyclical tendencies and sometimes net debt burdens, while retailers and restaurants are struggling to factor in how weight-loss drugs will impact their operations. Pharma (XLV) always has to contend with changing healthcare regulations, and while there are some gems in biotech (IBB), they tend to be hit or miss, most of the time. Most of old media is struggling from a streaming hangover, and their balance sheets leave a lot to be desired, too. We've never been fans of financials (XLF) due to the arbitrary nature of their cash flows, and the view that a \"run-on-the-bank\" dynamic will always be present will almost always keep us on the sidelines. However, a look at big cap tech and large cap growth shows secular-growing, net-cash-rich, free cash flow generating powerhouses.Microsoft ended its third quarter with ~$144 billion in total cash and short-term investments and short-term debt of ~$25.8 billion and long-term debt of $41.9 billion, translating into a very robust net cash position. The company's operating cash flow absolutely exploded during the first nine months of this year, coming in at ~$30.6 billion versus ~$23.2 billion in the same period last year. Capital spending was ~$9.9 billion for the first nine months of 2023, and while this is up from ~$6.3 billion in last year's quarter, Microsoft's free cash flow generation has nonetheless been phenomenal so far in 2023. Microsoft's revenue growth was a stellar ~12% in constant currency during the third quarter, too, making Microsoft a net-cash-rich, free-cash-flow generating, secular growth powerhouse.Alphabet ended its most recently-reported third quarter of 2023 with total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of ~$119.9 billion versus long-term debt of just ~$13.8 billion, good enough for a huge net cash position. Alphabet probably has the best balance sheet out there given how much financial flexibility it has to defend its economic moat in search and other areas. The company's free cash flow during the first nine months of 2023 came in at a whopping ~$61.6 billion, up from $44 billion during the same period a year ago. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, revenue growth at Alphabet was ~11%, putting it in a similar class as Microsoft with a label as a net-cash-rich, free-cash-flow generating, secular growth powerhouse.Meta Platforms (META) ended the third quarter of 2023 with total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $61.1 billion versus long-term debt of ~$18.4 billion, also good for a very nice net cash position. Meta's adjusted free cash flow came in at $31.5 billion through the first nine months of 2023, up materially from the depressed levels of ~$13.2 billion it achieved during the same period a year ago. The free cash flow growth at Meta was very welcome news, and something that was a big concern of ours toward the back half of 2022 when things really fell apart at the company. Revenue growth came in at a whopping 23% for Meta, which was very welcome given the competitive environment with respect to TikTok, and putting things all together, Meta is yet another net-cash-rich, free-cash-flow, secular-growth powerhouse.During much of 2022, pundits championed the 60/40 stock/bond portfolio and the equal-weight S&P 500 (RSP), but these areas have unfortunately underperformed during 2023. I don't want to jinx the current state of trends because I'm a big fan of how the market has gone thus far in 2023, but it seems that sticking with the DCF-backed big winners thus far in 2023 in big cap tech and large cap growth could make for a good strategy for the remainder of 2023 and into 2024. These areas aren't resting on their laurels either. Big cap tech and large cap growth continue to disrupt themselves in artificial intelligence [AI], and to me, this speaks to the sustainability of their business model. Whether it's Alphabet or Microsoft that gain in search due to AI, for example, they're both nicely represented in big cap tech and large cap growth.The reality is that the markets could very well be at the top of the first inning when it comes to AI. Big cap tech and large cap growth have already taken steps to become leaner, but could you imagine if they really turn up the gears in cost savings, not only with respect to headcount but also when it comes to the applications that AI may bring? Big cap tech and large cap growth tend to keep plowing money into their businesses to keep innovation moving in the right direction, but this decade could turn into the age of efficiency, too. If the market starts to sniff this out in the coming quarters and years, we could very well \"crash higher.\" Meta Platforms has shown what it can do when it focuses on efficiency. Can you imagine if this becomes the norm among the largest enterprises? It's just hard not to be bullish on big cap tech and large cap growth these days.Sometimes, commentators say it's too late to the game to jump on the bandwagon. For us, however, we've been huge fans of these areas for a very long time now, but just like it may be the top of the first inning for AI, it may be the top of the first inning when it comes to cost savings and productivity initiatives for these two important leadership areas of the market, too. I'm talking huge earnings expansion and tremendous free cash flow growth in these areas because of AI--not just what it may bring on the top line but the savings on the expense line, too. AI may bring the best of both worlds to the financial statements, and while AI may benefit other names in other sectors, too, it's clear that big cap tech and large cap growth whether via Microsoft or Alphabet or another large name holds the keys to the castle. This isn't the dot-com bust by any stretch, as big cap tech and large cap growth already generate tremendous amounts of free cash flow and have balance sheets that are simply impregnable.During the raging bull market of 2021, many were excited about the potential for this decade to be the Roarin' 20s, and while I've jokingly joined in on such excitement, I really do believe that this decade will be absolutely phenomenal for equity holders, but for those equity holders that are in the right spots, as 2023 has shown. Many may be flocking to bonds now as interest rates rise -- in similar fashion as perhaps others did with the 60/40 stock/bond portfolio and equal weight S&P 500 last year -- but to me it's a great time to be a long-term equity investor in big cap tech and large cap growth. I see AI as a huge game changer, and I view all the work the Fed has done in raising rates as potential dry powder to stimulate this Roarin' 20s economy on a continued upward trend. Maybe it's not this quarter or even next year when it happens, but I think this market has all the potential to \"crash higher.\" I continue to be bullish.This article was written byAnalyst\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Disclosure: I/we have a beneficial long position in the shares of RSP, SCHG either through stock ownership, options, or other derivatives.

            "description": "Walt Disney Co.'s stock climbed 3.5% in extended trading Wednesday after the media giant announced earnings that beat estimates, a huge jump in streaming users, and a vow to increase its annual efficiency cost reductions to $7.5 billion from $5.5 billion.Walt Disney Co.\u2019s stock climbed 3.3% in extended trading Wednesday after the media giant announced earnings that beat estimates, a huge jump in streaming users and vowed to increase annual cost cuts to $7.5 billion, from $5.5 billion.\u201cWe are most focused on profitability by the end of fiscal 2024,\u201d Disney Chief Executive Robert Iger told CNBC in an interview after the results were announced. He said Disney expects to grow free cash flow in fiscal 2024 significantly, approaching levels last achieved pre-pandemic.Disney DIS, -0.01% reported fiscal fourth-quarter net income of $264 million, or 14 cents a share. After adjusting for restructuring costs and other effects, Disney reported earnings of 82 cents a share. Revenue rose 5% to $21.24 billion, from $20.15 billion a year ago.Analysts surveyed by FactSet had, on average, expected adjusted earnings of 71 cents a share on revenue of $21.37 billion.Disney reworked how it breaks out business segments. Its largest, entertainment, generated $9.52 billion in revenue, up 2% from the same quarter a year ago.Experiences took in $8.2 billion, an increase of 11% from $7.3 billion last year. Sports, which includes ESPN, generated $3.9 billion. \u201cESPN is the No. 1 brand on TikTok,\u201d Iger said in a conference call with analysts late Wednesday.Iger later told analysts that the advertising market isn\u2019t as \u201cbad as some people think it is,\u201d fueled by sales on Disney+ and Hulu.Disney+ added nearly 7 million subscribers globally, leading to a substantially lower quarterly loss of $387 million, compared with a loss of $1.47 billion in the same quarter last year. Iger credited the popularity of movies like \u201cElemental,\u201d \u201cLittle Mermaid\u201d and \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,\u201d as well as original series \u201cAhsoka\u201d and the Korean original series \u201cMoving.\u201dThe company said a combined Disney+/Hulu streaming app will launch in beta for bundle subscribers in December. The service officially launches in late March 2024, according to Iger.Disney, which announced a price hike in August, is battling for streaming supremacy with media giants Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.70%, Netflix Inc. NFLX, +0.82%, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -0.57%, Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. WBD, -2.84% D, Comcast Corp. CMCSA, -0.83%, and others.As the company celebrates its 100th anniversary, it faces a labyrinth of problems. While Iger races to turn a profit with the streaming business, he must navigate a protracted actors strike, a dip in attendance at Disney World Resort in Orlando, Fla., legal antagonisms with Republican presidential candidate Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, and uncertainty around a CEO succession plan.\u201cYou can look at the results today and see that not only are our domestic parks doing well, well we got some difficult, comparable or comparisons in terms of the Florida parks but the international parks are doing extremely well as is our cruise business,\u201d Iger said in the CNBC interview.Disney\u2019s interim Chief Financial Officer Kevin Lansberry deemed attendance at Disneyland Park in Anaheim, Calif., as \u201cvery strong\u201d during the analyst call.Shares of Disney, at their lowest in nearly a decade, are down 8% since Iger returned as CEO a year ago, and have slipped 2.7% this year. The S&P 500 SPX has climbed 14%.Cisco slashed its revenue forecast for the fiscal year, and its shares were plunging in Wednesday's extended session.Jon Swartz is a senior reporter for MarketWatch in San Francisco, covering many of the biggest players in tech, including Netflix, Facebook and Google.

            "description": "Almost nobody on Wall Street has the temerity to bet against the \"Magnificent Seven\" group of tech stocks.Almost nobody on Wall Street has the temerity to bet against the \u201cMagnificent Seven.\u201d Data from a team of quantitative-equity strategists at Bank of America showed that short interest in the group, which includes seven of the eight most valuable publicly traded U.S. companies, has fallen to an all-time low at around 1% of the group\u2019s aggregate market capitalization, as illustrated in the chart below. The combined market capitalization of the Magnificent Seven members \u2014 Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.69%, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +1.56%, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, +1.65%, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -0.57%, Nvidia Corp. NVDA, +0.46%, Meta Platforms Inc. META, +0.09% and Tesla Inc. TSLA, -4.25% \u2014 was just shy of $11.3 trillion on Wednesday, with Apple, the most valuable U.S. company, accounting for more than $2.8 trillion, according to FactSet data. In a note to clients, the team questioned who might be left to buy these megacap names as their valuation relative to the rest of the market reaches extremely stretched levels. According to Dow Jones Market Data, the Magnificent Seven have driven all of the S&P 500 index\u2019s appreciation in 2023, offsetting an aggregate loss in shares of the other 493 companies included in the index. According to BofA\u2019s data, long-only funds are overweight every member of the group except Apple and Tesla. Plenty of Wall Street analysts believe these companies can continue to outperform. In a note to clients shared with MarketWatch on Wednesday, strategists at Capital Economics said the group could continue its stretch of market-beating performance even in a recession, thanks to the companies\u2019 strong balance sheets and prospects for earnings growth. \u201cGiven our pessimistic view of the economy in the U.S., we think that equities there will fare quite poorly in the near term. But the biggest components of the S&P 500 might hold up better,\u201d the team said in written commentary. Strong earnings forecasts also factored into their bullish view. Thanks in part to the artificial-intelligence boom, expected earnings growth for the Magnificent Seven over the next year dwarfs that of the rest of the S&P 500. U.S. stocks finished mixed on Wednesday, but the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP kept pace with the S&P 500, gaining 0.1% to finish at 13,650.41, according to FactSet data. The S&P 500 SPX rose 0.1% to 4,382.80. Gains for Magnificent Seven members helped offset weakness in other Nasdaq stocks, with Nvidia and Microsoft among the best performers in the group. Barclays analysts have been pounding the table over the benefits of cash this year. It's time to switch to stocks, they say.Joseph Adinolfi is a markets reporter at MarketWatch.

Learn MoreSome investors may be baffled by Apple (AAPL 0.74%) stock's strong performance recently, including a gain of more than 5% over the last week and nearly 39% year to date. They may wonder: Shouldn't the fact that Apple's revenue declined nearly 3% year over year in fiscal 2023 weigh on stock price performance? But there's a strong catalyst bubbling under the surface, keeping the bulls upbeat.One key part of Apple's business bulls are betting on is none other than its services segment -- a segment consisting of revenue streams that are more consistent, reliable, and predictable than the company's hardware sales. We're talking about Apple's revenue from advertising, AppleCare, cloud services, digital content, and payment services. Together, these high-margin, fast-growing parts of Apple's business are transforming the company.Here's a closer look at why Apple's services business is such a strong catalyst for the stock.You can't talk about Apple's services business without acknowledging its installed base of active devices, numbered in the billions. Though Apple didn't provide an updated figure on exactly how many Apple devices are being actively used around the world, Apple's chief financial officer Luca Maestri did say during the company's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings call that it \"continues to grow at a nice pace...\" As of the company's last update on its size, Apple said it boasted more than two billion active devices.This installed base \"establishes a solid foundation\" for continued expansion of its services business, Maestri said during the company's earnings call.Highlighting services' incredible momentum, the segment's fiscal Q4 16% year-over-year revenue growth was fueled by growth in every services category and geographic segment. This is \"a direct result of the strength of our ecosystem,\" Maestri explained.One area of services worth calling out, which management said continued to grow at a strong pace during fiscal Q4, is paid subscriptions.\"We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, nearly double the number we had only three years ago,\" Maestri noted.Notably, there's a flywheel effect at play for Apple's services business. Increasing content and features for its services segment leads to more engagement, and greater engagement leads to more satisfied customers and ultimately bolsters the total number of active devices. More active devices, of course, means Apple can invest more aggressively in content and features.Maestri described this flywheel effect during the tech company's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings call.And really then we step back and we think about why is it that our services business is doing well, and it's because we have an installed base of customers that continues to grow at a very nice pace, and the engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow.We have more transacting accounts. We have more paid accounts. We have more subscriptions on the platform. And we continue to ... add content and features. We're adding a lot of content on TV+, new games on Apple Arcade, new features, new storage plans for iCloud. So it's the combination of all these things and the fact that the engagement in the ecosystem is improving, and therefore, it benefits every service category.But services' strong top-line growth and broad-based underlying momentum is only half of the picture. Investors can't fully appreciate Apple's services business until they realize how lucrative it is. Apple's services gross profit margin in fiscal Q4 was 70.9%. This compares to its average gross profit margin of 36.6% for its hardware. In fact, Apple's strong growth in services, combined with the segment's high gross profit margin, is the main reason the company grew its earnings per share 13% year over year in fiscal Q4 despite revenue falling almost 1%.Today, Apple's services business accounts for less than a fourth of revenue and 39% of its gross profit. This powerful catalyst, however, looks poised to only become more important to the company over time. Patient and long-term oriented investors, therefore, have a good reason to be bullish on the stock.Daniel Sparks has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Learn MoreThe Nasdaq-100 index has dipped about 5% since mid-July as macroeconomic headwinds have caused declines across the tech market. Over the last three months, many of the biggest names in the industry have experienced either dips in their stock prices or little to no growth. However, recent challenges are why it's crucial to have a long-term mindset when investing in tech stocks.The sector is in a near-constant state of innovation and is known for rewarding patient investors with substantial returns. For instance, Apple (AAPL 0.74%) and Microsoft (MSFT 1.67%) have experienced stock declines of 9% and 2%, respectively, since July. Meanwhile, Amazon's (AMZN -0.70%) stock has risen slightly at 4%. However, the chart below proves that stockholders who bought in five years ago are still significantly up on their investments.Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon remain leaders in their respective markets and likely have much to offer investors over the long term. A recent sell-off in tech could be the perfect time to invest in these companies and reap the rewards for years to come. So, here are three top tech stocks to buy in November.Data by YChartsApple hasn't had it easy this year as an economic downturn has caused reductions in consumer spending across tech. The company's earnings release on Nov. 2 represented its fourth consecutive quarter of revenue declines, with net sales tumbling 3% year over year for fiscal 2023. Apple's product segments were hit particularly hard, with iPhone revenue dipping 2% for the year and Mac sales plunging 27%.Despite the declines, the company's Q4 2023 outperformed analyst expectations on several fronts. Earnings per share hit $1.46, beating forecasts by $0.07. Meanwhile, revenue for the quarter came in just slightly higher than expected. The bright spot for Apple over the last year and its recent quarter has been services, which hit revenue growth of 16% in Q4 and 9% for the year. While the challenges haven't been favorable for current stockholders, they have reduced the cost of entry for new ones. Apple's price-to-earnings ratio has decreased by 11% since July to about 28, meaning its shares offer more value than any other company on this list. Apple remains one of the biggest names in tech and has a big chance to rally in the long term, with a booming services business and a growing venture into AI. November is an excellent time to consider adding Apple shares to your portfolio.Microsoft has emerged as one of the most exciting artificial intelligence (AI) companies in 2023. The tech giant arguably has more earnings potential in the industry than almost any other organization, and that's thanks to the dominance of its products and vast financial resources.The company was an early investor in AI, sinking $1 billion into ChatGPT developer OpenAI in 2019. Microsoft has since increased that figure by another $10 billion, achieving a 49% stake in the start-up. The partnership has allowed the company to bring AI upgrades across its product lineup, including Word, Excel, Bing, Azure, and more.The combination of Microsoft's nearly unrivaled dominance in productivity software with OpenAI's technology creates endless earning opportunities. In addition to attracting new cloud customers to Azure, the company is monetizing its AI offerings on Microsoft 365 and enjoying boosts to revenue as a result.In Q1 2024 (ended September 2023), revenue rose nearly 13% year over year, beating Wall Street estimates by $2 billion. The growth came alongside a 13% increase in productivity income (which includes Microsoft 365 revenue) and a 19% bump in cloud sales.Microsoft is on a promising growth trajectory and has much to gain as the AI market expands, making now a compelling time to buy its stock before it's too late.Amazon has made an impressive comeback this year after its stock plunged 50% in 2022, burdened by macroeconomic headwinds. The company's stock has climbed 65% since Jan. 1, being one of the few tech companies to keep Wall Street consistently bullish in recent months. Amazon has rallied investors with significant growth in its e-commerce segments and a promising expansion into AI.In Q3 2023, revenue rose close to 13% year over year, beating expectations by $1.5 billion. The growth was mainly thanks to improvements in Amazon's retail segments, with its North American division reporting an 11% boost in revenue and international sales rising 16%.In addition to e-commerce growth, Amazon is using its leading market share in cloud computing to carve out a lucrative position in AI. The company is rapidly expanding its AI tools on AWS, cashing in on the soaring demand for such services.Amazon is back on a growth path, with solid long-term outlooks in e-commerce and AI. Meanwhile, the company's average 12-month price target of $172 projects stock growth of 24% and indicates it still has plenty to offer new investors. Amazon is a top tech stock this November and seems too good to pass up.John Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.
