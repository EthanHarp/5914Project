            "description": "The third-quarter earnings season has largely been mixed so far, reflecting the impact of the economic uncertainties on profit growth. That said, data suggests S&P 500 companies may be on track to break a fourth-quarter earnings-declining streak. \nA Mixed Bag Laced With Caution: Last week, Investors reacted to disappointing earnings reports from some high-profile companies such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG). The former spooked investors with softer-than-expected cloud revenue and the latter with its cautious guidance. \nTwo of the fellow \u201cMagnificent Seven,\u201d namely Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) calmed investors\u2019 nerves, either with stellar results or positive commentary regarding the near term. Chip earnings were also a mixed bag, with Texas Instruments, Inc. (NASDAQ:TXN) reporting a third-quarter miss, while Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC) cheered investors with a solid beat and positive outlook.\nEnergy giants Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX) reported below-consensus earnings for the quarter, and this served as a drag on the profit growth of S&P 500 companies.\nMidway into the season, about 49% of the S&P 500 companies have released their earnings so far, with 78% of the companies reporting earnings beats and 62% ringing in revenue upside, data from FactSet shows.\nThe year-over-year blended earnings growth rate of S&P 500 companies is expected at 2.7%, potentially marking the first growth since the third quarter of 2022.\nEarnings Deluge Awaits:  The tech earnings news flow continues in the unfolding week, with the likes of Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) on tap. A slew of SMID-cap companies are also scheduled to disclose their quarterly earnings scorecard.\nThe earnings assume ...Full story available on Benzinga.com",

            "description": "The outbreak of war in the Middle East is threatening to hamper the Fed's efforts to control inflation.\nA Thursday visit from Secretary of State Antony Blinken to Israel was confirmation of unconditional support from the U.S. for Israel in its war against Palestinian terrorist organization Hamas.\nIsrael\u2019s military reported on Thursday afternoon that over 1,200 people, including at least 27 Americans, have been killed by Hamas\u2019 attacks, with around 2,800 individuals injured.
