Please scroll down to see the protection band.\n\nJobless Claims\nJobless claims show that the jobs picture remains strong.\u00a0Initial jobless claims came at 217K ...Full story available on Benzinga.com",

The two electric vehicle manufacturers had differing outcomes, leading to divergent stock performances in after-hours trading.\nWhat Happened:\u00a0Rivian upgraded its 2023 production guidance from 52,000 units to 54,000 units due to robust demand for its SUVs and pickups, as noted by\u00a0Future Fund\u2018s\u00a0Gary Black\u00a0in a recent X, formerly Twitter, post.

Black noted that Rivian CEO\u00a0R.J. Scaringe\u00a0exuded immense confidence in the company\u2019s future, particularly with regard to the R2 platform.

Nevertheless, the company is gradually reducing losses and charting a path toward profitability.\nThe First Deliveries:\u00a0In late 2021, Rivian embarked on its journey of delivering its first vehicles. Throughout the entire year, 920 vehicles were delivered.\nHowever, in the second quarter of this year, the company reached a milestone by delivering 12,640 vehicles while incurring a gross loss per unit delivered of $32,595, down 79.3% as compared to the corresponding quarter of 2022 and down 51.6% quarter-on-quarter.\nThe R1T begins at $73,000, while the more premium R1S SUV starts at $78,000.\n\nFacing Bankruptcy or Positive Cash Flow:\u00a0Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO\u00a0Elon Musk\u00a0warned in June 2022 that both Rivian and\u00a0Lucid Group Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:LCID)\u00a0might face bankruptcy\u00a0due to their substantial spending. However, BNP Paribas Exane\u2019s senior automotive analyst,\u00a0James Picariello, holds a different perspective.\nPicariello told Benzinga, \u201cWhile Rivian's loss per vehicle remains in the tens of thousands of dollars, over the next 12 months, it will implement LFP batteries, its internally developed Enduro drive units (using two internally developed units instead of four outsourced ones from Bosch), and by mid-next year, it will transition to a more efficient 2nd-gen architecture, resulting in a 60% reduction in the vehicle\u2019s ECUs.\u201d\u00a0\nHe also noted that Musk might have ...Full story available on Benzinga.com",
