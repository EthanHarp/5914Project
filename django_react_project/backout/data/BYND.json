Investors flocked to safe-haven assets, with Treasuries rallying and the dollar advancing on the FX market.\nCues From Tuesday's Trading:\nThe S&P 500 fell nearly 1%, briefly hitting the lowest level since June 12. The Dow slipped by 270 points or 0.8%. Both the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 and the Russell 2000 tumbled 1.4%. \n                                                               US Index Performance On Monday\n\n\n\n\nIndex \nPerformance (+/-)\nValue\n\n\nNasdaq 100\n(1.39%)\n15,201.55\n\n\nS&P 500 Index\n(0.96%)\n4,480.72\n\n\nDow Industrials\n(0.80%)\n35,198.72\n\n\nRussell 2000\n(1.35%)\n1,934.36\n\n\n\n\nAnalyst Color:\nStocks have moved a bit past what is justified by fundamentals, said LPL Financial analysts Jeffrey Buchbinder ...Full story available on Benzinga.com",
