            "description": "Michael Burry closed out his large short positions against the S&P 500 and Nasdaq in Q3. Click here for a detailed review.Astrid StawiarzAstrid StawiarzIn today's article, we bring you the latest update in our recurring series based on analyzing 13F filings and the latest moves of some of the world's most renowned funds and asset managers. Our original article on the matter and the main thesis behind it can be accessed through this link.Scion Asset Management Q3 '23 Holdings Heatmap (Quiver Quantitative)Scion Asset Management Q3 '23 Holdings Heatmap (Quiver Quantitative)Last quarter Burry made headlines when his fund's 13F filing showed large short positions against both the S&P 500 and also the tech heavy Nasdaq tracker (QQQ) managed by Invesco. These positions were entirely closed out in Q3 and considering the fact that neither of those indices fell more than 5% in the third quarter they were likely at little to no gain. Turnover in his portfolio was again exceptionally high. Only 8 of the 42 positions Scion Asset Management held in Q2 were still held come the end of September. Crescent Energy Company (CRGY) and The RealReal, Inc. (REAL) were both reduced while Euronav NV (EURN), Nexstar Media Group, Inc. (NXST), Safe Bulkers, Inc. (SB), Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. (HPP), Star Bulk Carriers Corp. (SBLK), and Stellantis N.V. (STLA) were all expanded. The rest of the positions were entirely closed out. Estimated AUM fell to around $44 million which is certainly down from last quarter although by how much is hard to determine. With current SEC guidelines there's no requirement to disclose option contract prices, just the price of the underlying asset. Since the funds' short positions against SPY and QQQ were made through buying put contracts it was nearly impossible to determine the monetary size of those holdings. As for new positions there were just four opened most of which we'll discuss at more length below but several of them are stocks which Burry has now consistently bought and sold and then bought and sold on a quarterly basis.Stellantis N.V.: Burry first opened this position sometime in Q2 of this year, prior to any major reports of what would become a major strike by members of the UAW Union who represent much of the auto-makers workforce. Ultimately, STLA reached a deal with the UAW and share prices never fell more than 10-15% during the strikes. In fact since the end of Q2 the stock is up 16% and Burry seems to think it's going higher considering in Q3 he added 75,000 shares to the 325,000 he already had. He would have been able to purchase shares this quarter anywhere between $17 and $20. The world's 8th largest auto-maker by market cap now is the largest position held by Scion Asset Management, at current prices its market value is around $8.1 million.Nexstar Media Group: Nexstar is a TV media and broadcasting group that owns brands such as News Nation, The CW Network, and several more. Burry opened this position last quarter as well although he bought only 15,000 shares compared to the 33,651 he purchased this quarter making it the second largest holding for his fund and growing the position by more than 200% overall. Shares this most recent quarter would have been bought between $133 and $186 versus between $150 and $178 in Q2 so he was likely able to average down his entry price a bit. After surging more than 20% in the first month of the year the stock has struggled since, now down close to 15% YTD.Star Bulk Carriers: Burry opened this position last quarter as well and grew it by about 35% this quarter but considering how many positions were closed out, SBLK moved from 17th largest to 3rd largest in the funds portfolio. The shipping company is based out of Greece and transports a wide variety of bulk commodities across global markets. Shares would have been bought between around $3 to $3.50 versus between $3.25 and $3.80, so another opportunity to average down in a stock the investor seemingly has some strong conviction in.Euronav NV: While Euronav's market is entirely crude oil this is ultimately still a bet on the shipping and transportation industry. It makes for the third stock in that sector that Burry grew his position in. EURN operates out of Belgium and operates and owns its own fleet of ships used to move crude oil across the globe. They have had a solid year so far staying pretty much right on pace with the overall market returning about 11-12% YTD. Burry first opened this position in Q2 when shares traded between $14 and $18 and they've continued to trade in the same range since. His fund now owns 250,000 shares of the oil transporter making it the 8th largest holding.iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX): Similarly to the QQQ and SPY puts, this new short position Burry opened against the BlackRock (BLK) ETF with holdings like (AMD), (NVDA), (AVGO), and (INTC) is of an unknown size. The filing shows a new put position of 100,000 shares against SOXX. Even at that it's unclear if he holds 100,000 shares through contracts which would mean he holds 1,000 put contracts or if he in fact purchased 100,000 total put contracts. Nonetheless the new position is worth taking note of especially when we consider some of the activity in the sector. The NVDA CEO has been selling 10's of millions of dollars worth of shares over the last several months, Buffett closed out of Berkshire's massive Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) position in Q1 of this year less than a year after it was opened, and tensions between U.S. and China has all but lessened in the last year or so. That said, there haven't been many signs that the industry will slow down. The index is now up close to 50% YTD and the majority of chip-makers reported strong Q3 earnings back in late October. SOXX traded as high as $535 and as low as $460 in Q3 when Burry was purchasing put contracts, today it trades around $510.Burry 13F Filing (EDGAR)Burry 13F Filing (EDGAR)JD.Com, Inc. (JD) & Alibaba Group Holding (BABA): Burry's relationship with JD and BABA which is also a new position this quarter is volatile. I chose to combine these two into one section considering how correlated Burry's trading of the two stocks has been. At the beginning of Q2 these were Scion's largest two holdings only to be entirely closed out during the quarter. They had just previously been opened in the first quarter of this year as well. Now it seems his appetite for the Chinese tech stocks has reawakened as he bought 125,000 shares of JD and 50,000 BABA shares in Q3. JD has been getting crushed this year, down about 50% so far, giving Burry an opportunity to purchase shares in the $28-41 range. Today the stock trades at $28-29 per share. BABA has had a better year although not a fantastic one, down about 12% so far. This most recent quarter BABA shares traded between $84 and $102 versus today's price of around $87. The two stocks again moved to the top of the fund's holdings with JD and BABA now the 7th and 5th spots in terms of percent of AUM. JD released earnings on November 15th just a day after Burry's filing and shares jumped close to 10% in opening trading. In line with its peer, BABA also gapped up around 5% at open.Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG): This was the only other new position this quarter and it's unique. The fund purchased 1,500 shares of the major travel services firm and at the same time purchased put options shorting it. In the picture below you can see the holdings directly from the filing. Best guess is Burry is engaged in some sort of covered put strategy however that would imply that the 1,500 shares held by the fund are actually sold short. Current 13F filings are not required to disclose whether or not shares are sold short.Burry 13F Filing (EDGAR)Burry 13F Filing (EDGAR)Almost all positions that were reduced were ultimately closed out but two were shrank and still remain in the funds portfolio today. The RealReal and Crescent Energy Company. REAL operates an online marketplace for reselling luxury goods and has been held by Burry and his fund since the first quarter of this year. CRGY is an energy company operating in natural gas, crude oil, and NGLs.This section won't focus on any one particular stock as we've usually done in the past as most of the portfolio was turned over. The most notable close out was of the short positions against SPY and QQQ made through a number of put contracts. As we mentioned in the intro these positions were likely closed out a little to no gain. Considering both indices have gained more than 5% since the end of Q3 his sales probably came at a good time.Other notable close outs include Expedia Group (EXPE), Charter Communications (CHTR), which were the 3rd and 4th largest holdings for Burry's fund last quarter outside of the short positions. The CHTR shares were purchased in Q2 between $320 and $368 and were sold for as high as $455 and as low as $368 but presumably at a nice gain. The EXPE position was also opened in Q2 and was averaged in between $89 and $112. Burry could have sold shares for as high as $122 but following poor Q2 earnings in late July shares gapped down more than 10% and continued to slip to as low as $99 a share.Following the hack at MGM Resorts International (MGM) this position was closed out as well and was previously the 8th largest holding. Longtime Burry stock, The GEO Group (GEO), finally exited the portfolio entirely. This was the largest holding for Scion for nearly all of last year. The CVS Health Corporation (CVS) position, which was held for just one quarter, was closed out at what could have been upwards of a nice 15% gain. He made another potentially solid trade on Generac Holdings (GNRC) which was a position also held just from Q2 to Q3 of this year. Shares could have been acquired for as low as $93 in April before they started to run all the way up to $149 by the end of June. However, that's about as high as they went, peaking around $153 on August 1st just to tank some 25% the next day on second quarter earnings results. Shares traded as low as $103 in late September so Burry certainly made money on this trade, it's just a question of how much. All in all by the end of Q3 a total of 20 positions from the previous quarter had been closed out.Quarter to quarter turnover is always high in Dr. Burry's portfolio but this quarter sets the bar even higher. That said as you might have taken away from the 'Closed Positions' section he made a number of exceptionally well timed individual stock picks minus the short positions against SPY and QQQ. He's done pretty much the same thing this quarter with a relatively diverse selection of stocks across 5 to 6 different sectors. The position that will likely receive the most attention from his portfolio this quarter is the short against the semiconductor industry. While this has financial implications there are also larger geo-political scenarios, primarily involving the U.S. and China, which might need to play out for such a hot sector to take a hit. Most of the top ten holdings in SOXX are up at least 50% YTD. The fund also has vigorously traded Chinese tech stocks JD and BABA so it seems Burry has honed his focus on playing foreign policy events concerning the two largest economies on the globe.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

            "title": "Nvidia is pushing to stay ahead of Intel, AMD in a high-stakes, high-performance computing race",
            "description": "AI and gaming giant is leaving no gap for competitors.Nvidia NVDA, +0.45% was built on the promise of the GPU for gaming and advanced rendering, but its rise to a $1 trillion valuation was on the back of high-performance computing and AI. What began as a small project called \u201cgeneral purpose GPU\u201d (GPGPU) that looked at in-game physics and video transcoding applications transformed the company into the titan of the silicon space, displacing Intel as the clear thought-leader for the future of computing. What has made Nvidia successful in this transition from being a gaming company to one of the premier computing and AI leaders is its ability to not just build silicon, but to build an entire platform and ecosystem. It calls this the \u201cNvidia Scientific Computing Platform\u201d and it\u2019s a combination of hardware including its Hopper GPU and Grace CPU with system software such as CUDA and PhysX that aim to simplify the programming models for developers. Add on to that end-to-end platforms including Nvidia Omniverse and Nvidia AI and you get applications that can spur scientific development and AI advancement, all of course optimized for Nvidia silicon.But like all titans, Nvidia constantly needs to stay ahead of the curve and competitors. The company\u2019s struggle is to maintain the momentum that got it where it is. At SC23, the leading conference for high-performance computing, Nvidia this week made a couple of interesting product announcements and gave some insight on its thinking about the next big thing in high-performance computing.The primary announcement from Nvidia was the H200, a mid-generation update to the H100 Hopper GPU that makes significant advancements in the memory design. By moving from HBM3 (high bandwidth memory) to HBM3e, the new H200 can improve memory bandwidth and maximum memory capacity, and as a result offer significant performance improvements over the current generation H100 product.Memory technology is often just as important to high performance computing (HPC) systems as the GPU or CPU itself. New AI models and HPC workloads will test the limits of memory capacity. The new Nvidia H200 increases memory capacity by 76% and memory bandwidth by 43%. Nvidia was already the market leader in this space so the improvements might seem superficial. But as Intel INTC, +5.92% continues to push its GPU and Gaudi AI accelerator strategy, and AMD AMD, +1.68% executes the roll out of its MI300 AI chip, its critical for Nvidia to stay aggressive.Read: Nvidia\u2019s stock notches longest winning streak in seven years, with all-time high in viewFor investors interested in what Nvidia has planned next, the company teased performance of its upcoming architecture (codenamed Blackwell) and the B100 GPU slated for 2024 as offering more than twice the performance of the H200 in a GPT-3 AI inference benchmark, similar to the work needed for AI chatbots like ChatGPT.Nvidia walked out numerous partners and customers to back up both the product claims and long-term commitments. For example, the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking, a group founded in 2018 to invest in European supercomputing systems) showed the plan for a supercomputer named \u2018Jupiter\u2019 with almost 24,000 GH200 nodes, the combination of Arm-based Grace CPUs and Hopper GPUs. Another was the Texas Advanced Computing Center, one of the U.S. centers of computational excellence, which has a system called \u2018Vista\u2019 that will use both GH200 Grace Hopper and Grace CPU superchips.Perhaps the most substantial change to computing will be the move to quantum systems. Quantum computing differs from classical computing in that it depends on quantum mechanics, rather than simple electrical impulses used in classical computing. Quantum computing can help solve problems that require calculating large numbers of combinations, like machine learning and encryption, faster than any currently available supercomputers. For now, Nvidia does not have a QPU (quantum processing unit) in its stable of technology but that isn\u2019t stopping the company from being involved in this developing technology. Whether or not Nvidia chooses to build or perhaps buy quantum capability, it is creating the supporting hardware and software ecosystem for quantum compute to make sure that it isn\u2019t left out.From a hardware perspective, nearly all quantum computing systems today have associated classical computing systems that are used to simulate or control the quantum systems. This can be for error calculation, systems control, or simply for secondary processing where quantum devices do not excel. Nvidia calls these \u201chybrid quantum systems\u201d and it\u2019s a way for them to ensure that quantum engineers and system researchers are working with Nvidia throughout the process. Maybe even more ingenious is the creation of \u201cCUDA Quantum,\u201d which is the quantum equivalent to CUDA, the programming and software model that enabled Nvidia to dominate the AI and HPC spaces for the past 15 years. CUDA Quantum includes a high-level programming language that allows quantum system designers and application developers to write code that can run on both classical systems and quantum ones, diverting work between them or simply simulating the quantum portion. Nvidia claims that 92% of the top 50 quantum startups currently use Nvidia GPUs and software and 78% of companies building and deploying quantum processors use CUDA Quantum as their programming model.To me this represents a move that no other technology company today can make, enabling the high-performance computing industry that is already tailoring software for Nvidia GPUs and ensuring that the next generation of quantum applications are created as \u201cNvidia-first\u201d even before the company has a clear stake in the quantum computing hardware landscape.

Learn MoreAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD 1.78%) has been a company to watch this year as its shares have soared 80% since Jan. 1. The tech giant has benefited from a boom in artificial intelligence (AI), which has highlighted how crucial chipmakers are to the industry's future. AMD has been one of the biggest names in graphics processing units (GPUs), second only to Nvidia, in recent years. These chips are necessary in developing AI models, suggesting that AMD could have a lucrative role in the high-growth sector over the long term.In addition to AI, AMD is well positioned to profit significantly as the PC market recovers. The industry has been hit hard by macroeconomic headwinds over the last two years but is showing signs of improvement. AMD could see a spike in revenue in 2024 as PC and chip sales soar. As a result, now is an excellent time to learn more about this company and potentially invest in its stock.So, here are three things about AMD that smart investors know.The launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November 2022 reignited interest in AI and led countless companies to pivot their businesses to developing the industry. Nvidia has so far dominated the market, snapping an estimated 90% market share in AI chips. However, AMD is gearing up to challenge Nvidia next year by launching a new AI GPU.AMD unveiled the newest addition to its line of MI300 chips in June, described as its most powerful GPU ever. The new chip is designed to compete directly with Nvidia's offerings and comes at a time when the market is growing desperate for alternative chip options. Nvidia's dominance has led AI GPU prices to soar, giving AMD an exciting opportunity to offer better price to performance.The chipmaker has spent the last year improving its AI hardware and making various acquisitions that will allow it to provide developers with a top-tier experience when building AI models. Its stock could be a better option than Nvidia, with more room for growth in its AI division.PC shipments plunged 16% throughout 2022 and have continued falling in 2023. The declines have plagued companies across the industry, with AMD's client segment posting a 10% revenue dip in its client segment last year as central processing unit (CPU) sales faltered.However, the PC industry is gradually showing signs of recovery alongside easing inflation. In the third quarter of 2023, PC shipments fell roughly 8%, half of what it lost the year before. Meanwhile, the quarter saw AMD's client segment report revenue growth of 42% as operating income hit $140 million.The spike in chip sales allowed AMD to expand its desktop CPU market share by 5% in Q3 2023 (per Mercury Research), gaining on Intel. A return to growth in the PC market will be a massive win for AMD over the next year. Alongside its AI expansion, the company could be on a promising growth path.Nvidia has become a favorite on Wall Street this year, with its command of the AI market sending its shares soaring 233% year to date. While its meteoric rise has benefited current investors, it has also significantly raised the cost of entry for new ones. As a result, alternative AI companies like AMD have become far more attractive ways to back the budding market.Data by YCharts.The chart above compares AMD and Nvidia's price-to-earnings ratios and price-to-free cash flow. AMD's figures for both metrics are considerably lower than Nvidia's, suggesting AMD's stock offers far more value right now.AMD shares have risen high this year. However, the company still has plenty of room for growth, and its stock is an exciting buy ahead of its 2024 GPU launch and a recovering PC market.Dani Cook has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn MoreOne of the dominant themes surrounding technology companies this year is artificial intelligence (AI). Microsoft kicked things off after its multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI, the developer behind ChatGPT. Unsurprisingly, other Big Tech companies, such as Amazon and Alphabet, followed suit, with each investing in a rival generative AI opportunity called Anthropic.While these strategic investments were enough to spark some excitement among Wall Street and retail investors alike, I think the party really got started when semiconductor leader Nvidia released earnings back in May for its first quarter of fiscal 2024 ended April 30. After showcasing its dominant performance in data center services and advancements in graphics processor units (GPUs) , the stock has rocketed about 60%.But over that same time frame, Nvidia's top rival, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 1.75%), has only managed to move up about 8%. The lack of movement in the stock is almost startling, considering how much enthusiasm there is for chip stocks and AI exposure. In a way, it's as if the investment community at large has ditched AMD and poured everything into Nvidia.After AMD reported third-quarter earnings, I think the company demonstrated yet again how strong its operation is and why a long-term investment is compelling. Let's break down the earnings report and analyze the moves the company is making to take on Nvidia. Moreover, a closer look at management's long-term outlook relative to the stock's current valuation should help supplement the thesis around why now looks like a terrific opportunity to buy some shares in AMD.For the quarter ended Sept. 30, AMD reported total revenue of $5.8 billion, which represented a 4% increase year over year. The biggest contributor to revenue was AMD's data-center business, which generated $1.6 billion in sales. Although this was little changed year over year, there are some under-the-radar reasons to believe that this segment could witness surging growth sooner rather than later.About a month ago, I wrote a piece on AMD's acquisition of a machine learning start-up called Nod.ai. As I mentioned, AMD has a successful track record with mergers and acquisitions, and I viewed the Nod.ai deal as yet another savvy move by management. What made Nod.ai so compelling is that the company's technology aligns well with AMD's open-source vision as it relates to its AI roadmap. In AMD's Q3 investor presentation, I learned that the company also closed on another acquisition of a start-up called Mipsology.Both Nod.ai and Mipsology are now key components of AMD's data-center operation. Although the current growth trajectory may look mundane, I think AMD's ability to promptly identify technologies that can integrate with its own core services should not be overlooked. Moreover, AMD has yet to benefit in a meaningful way from either of these deals. I think that Nod.ai and Mipsology represent a unique opportunity to inject some new life into AMD's data-center business, and investors should be anything but discouraged about its current performance.Another important area to focus on is AMD's client segment. For the quarter ended in September, AMD reported $1.5 billion in client revenue, up a whopping 42% year over year. To me, this was the most encouraging part of the call as management assured investors that the return to growth was driven in large part by normalization in the PC market. For the last several quarters, management has attributed its poor performance in the client segment to waning demand for PCs. With the effects that inflation and high interest rates have on consumer discretionary spending, this dynamic isn't entirely unreasonable. Nonetheless, given the lingering nature of these macroeconomic factors on AMD's business, it's not surprising that some investors likely lost patience and moved on from the stock.With a return to growth in the client segment coupled with some exciting opportunities in the data-center unit via acquisitions, investors may want to know what management has to say about the future.Image source: AMD Investor Relations website.During the earnings call, management provided investors with its outlook for Q4 as well as a preview of next year. For Q4, management called for \"strong double-digit percentage\" growth in both data-center and client segment revenue. While this is nice to see, it was the commentary around next year that raised my eyebrows.Within the data-center business, management called for $400 million in revenue from data-center GPUs in Q4. However, investors learned that AMD believes revenue from data center GPUs could reach more than $2 billion in 2024. The catalyst fueling this growth is, of course, the \"rapid progress we are making with our AI road map execution,\" according to management.To say that AMD is bullish on its AI roadmap would be an understatement. AMD is laying the foundation for long-term growth built around AI. However, the majority of headlines and investor discussions seem to revolve around Big Tech, including Nvidia. To me, AMD represents a overlooked AI opportunity and is not getting enough credit for the moves it's been making.Image source: Getty Images.There are many ways to value a stock. As my thesis around AMD revolves around the long-term picture, I am going to look at the stock on a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple. Forward P/E can be useful because it accounts for estimated future growth. As of the time of this article, AMD stock trades at a forward P/E of roughly 31, much higher than the forward P/E of about 20 for the S&P 500.While this may imply that AMD stock is overvalued, I don't see it this way. AMD is a growth stock, and it very much trades like one. Given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry coupled with sentiment around AI, it's not unreasonable for AMD stock to experience such dramatic moves any given day.To me, there is more than enough evidence that AMD has strong growth prospects. I would not wait until the acquisitions begin to materially help the business to make an investment decision. Management did enough on the call to assure me that the moves it's making are the right ones to continue gaining momentum and market share against Nvidia. Although the stock may not look cheap, I think the growth prospects of AMD are stronger than the broader market, and therefore, the premium seems warranted. I think now is a fantastic opportunity to dollar-cost average into a surefire leader at the intersection of AI and semiconductors.John Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Learn MoreShares of artificial intelligence beneficiaries Super Micro Computer (SMCI -1.72%), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 1.75%), and Intel (INTC 6.30%) were rallying today, up 14.9%, 2.7%, and 3.1%, respectively.AMD was initiated with a \"buy\" rating at a sell-side firm today, but its move higher was likely due to the lower inflation print this morning, which lifted most stocks across the board.Semiconductor and AI hardware stocks are thought to be highly cyclical. The prospect of easing inflation and therefore lower interest rates is especially good for these sectors, barring a recession. The day started off especially well for AMD, which garnered a \"buy\" rating at sell-side firm Roth MKM. The firm has a $125 price target on AMD given its growth opportunities, especially in the data center.AMD stock recently rose on the back of CEO Lisa Su projecting at least $2 billion in revenue next year for AMD's MI300 AI accelerator, its new chip that it hopes will rival Nvidia (NVDA 0.45%) graphics processing units (GPUs) and make inroads into the red-hot AI data center market. Intel also hopes to make inroads in the data center, not only with the upcoming release of more advanced data center central processing units (CPUs) but also for its Gaudi AI accelerators. Intel is also embarking on an ambitious plan to construct a foundry to serve chip customers besides itself and may also benefit from potential AI customers. That build-out, however, will take a lot of capital.Today, a lower-than-expected consumer price index (CPI) reading lit a fire under virtually all stocks, as the new reading sparked hopes the Federal Reserve is now done with interest rate hikes and may even begin lowering them, hopefully without the economy having to enter a recession. That would greatly benefit Intel, which has seen its profits squeezed and cash flow go negative, as its foundry investments have coincided with a deep slump in its main PC processor business that generates most of its cash flow.So, a lower-rate environment would not only benefit sales of big-ticket items such as PCs but may also allow Intel to raise money at lower interest rates. Recently, Intel announced it was planning a sale of part of its FPGA business. Thanks to lower rates and a potentially improved economic outlook, Intel may be able to raise more money from that asset sale as well.Image source: Getty Images.Finally, Super Micro Computer has already been a huge winner in 2023, up 144%. But to start the day, it still found itself about 30% below its all-time high reached this year. Super Micro is seeing a huge growth and profit acceleration this year, as its energy-efficient and highly customizable servers have been big beneficiaries of the AI boom.Super Micro is now a $15 billion market-cap company, but its stock is volatile and is often grouped in with small-cap-stocks. The Russell 2000 small-cap index was up over 5% today, as stocks perceived as \"riskier\" rallied harder, given the relief in interest rates. Skeptics for Super Micro's year-to-date rally have also piled on, with the stock's short interest above 10% of the company's public-share float as of the end of October.At just 27 times trailing earnings and a low-teens multiple on this year's expectations, Super Micro has never traded at a demanding valuation. Still, it's possible those who feared higher rates for a longer period of time anticipated higher rates would eventually curtail investment in artificial intelligence. After all, AI chips and servers are very expensive, even though they may become table stakes for any company hoping to outdo rivals going forward.Yet with lower interest rates now a higher probability thanks to today's lower inflation reading, that could sustain or increase AI investment on the part of big cloud providers and others. So that sunnier outlook, perhaps with some short covering on top, fueled Super Micro's massive rally today. Many investors steer clear of semiconductor stocks because of their extreme volatility. However, if one chooses the right chip companies for a portfolio and takes a long-term perspective, many chip stocks have outperformed the markets and even the overall tech sector over the past decade. Therefore, those stocks at the forefront of the AI revolution are a must-add for young growth investors' portfolios.While one needs a strong stomach to weather bad years like 2022, today was a good example of why these stocks are great choices for the risk-on investors with lots of time to compound their wealth.Billy Duberstein has positions in Super Micro Computer and has the following options: short January 2025 $110 puts on Super Micro Computer, short January 2025 $125 puts on Super Micro Computer, short January 2025 $130 puts on Super Micro Computer, short January 2025 $280 calls on Super Micro Computer, short January 2025 $380 calls on Super Micro Computer, and short January 2025 $85 puts on Super Micro Computer.

Learn MoreThe wisdom of crowds is at work on the popular free trading platform Robinhood Markets. Among its most widely owned stocks, there is a diversified mixture of blue chips and rising stars that would be at home in any portfolio.Since January 2020, the top 100 most owned investments on Robinhood have slightly underperformed the Nasdaq Composite, but the advantage has swung back and forth.Through July 2021, the most owned Robinhood stocks were outperforming the market by a fair margin, which is not surprising. Growth stocks typically perform better in a rising market than vice versa. With the major indexes down over the last few years, this could be a great time to find future winners among Robinhood customers' favorite holdings.Here are two popular stocks I would consider buying right now.Top chipmakers have tremendous growth opportunities as the world shifts to advanced computing technologies like artificial intelligence (AI). Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 1.69%) are up big this year, but the stock is still trading 31% off its previous peak and could hit new highs over the next few years.AMD saw revenue growth slow last year amid macroeconomic headwinds, but it's starting to ramp up again. Its most recent business update showed revenue accelerating. The company is still seeing mixed performance in its data center business, but investments in AI will drive more growth from enterprise customers over the long term.On the consumer side, AMD's Ryzen 7000 chips, which feature an AI on-chip accelerator, have been a huge hit. The client segment posted a 42% year-over-year growth rate last quarter and should position AMD for more demand as Windows PCs implement new AI features.The growing demand for Ryzen is a great sign for AMD's market share gains against Intel, where it has delivered a better price-to-performance ratio for PC users in recent years. As the chipmaker prepares to ship its new data center GPU accelerators for AI workloads, it should grab at least a small share of the AI chip market away from Nvidia and further accelerate revenue growth to deliver market-beating returns to investors.Coinbase Global (COIN -1.88%) is one of the most widely used exchanges for buying cryptocurrencies, but the decline in the crypto market over the last few years has caused lower trading activity on the platform, and therefore sent the stock down 79% off its 2021 highs. The good news is that investors now get much more value out of the shares, because the long-term demand for digital currencies should only grow over time. Coinbase stock was trading at an expensive price-to-sales ratio of around 20 in 2021. It now trades at a more reasonable valuation of 7.9 times revenue.It's normal for brokerages to experience weak results in bear markets and strong growth in bull markets. Long-term investors can take advantage of these swings to buy shares on the cheap when trading activity is down, knowing it will pick up again in the next bull market. The stock has already rebounded 168% this year as investors anticipate a turnaround on the horizon, and indeed, there is a big catalyst in the near term that could drive more investor interest in cryptocurrencies.The Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs very soon. There are already plenty of cryptocurrency ETFs available, but a spot Bitcoin ETF directly tracks the changes in the asset's price through direct ownership of the digital currency.Top cryptocurrencies have been climbing in recent weeks as investors anticipate more institutional demand coming into the market once spot ETFs are approved. This could be the start of a new bull market for digital currencies and benefit Coinbase stock.John Ballard has positions in Advanced Micro Devices, Bitcoin, and Nvidia. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Advanced Micro Devices, Bitcoin, Coinbase Global, Microsoft, and Nvidia.

He added that the company\u2019s x86-based server processor market share increased from about 10% in 2020 to 25% by the middle of the calendar year 2023.AMD beat rival Intel Corp. INTC by reporting a 21% sequential increase in data center revenue compared to the latter\u2019s 3% growth in its DCAI revenue, DeSilva noted. He said this was achieved due to 50% sequential growth in the new EPYC Gen 4 server processor sales.DeSilva said that AMD has strong leverage to AI infrastructure growth, with its new MI300X AI accelerator likely gaining traction in the fast-growing market opportunity. AMD can better compete with Nvidia Corp. NVDA, the frontrunner in the AI race, due to the emergence of open-source AI development tools as an alternative to Nvidia\u2019s proprietary CUDA framework, he said. The analyst expects AMD\u2019s AI Instinct product sales to more than double quarter-over-quarter to $400 million in the fourth quarter, with revenue accelerating further to $2 billion in 2024.See Also: Best Artificial Intelligence StocksAMD\u2019s data center revenue will likely grow 36% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and 61% in 2024, the analyst said, citing his checks.DeSilva said that the chipmaker will also benefit from the cyclical opportunity in Gaming and Client PC recovery. \u201d While overall consumer demand has remained muted, we nonetheless expect these segments to exhibit a recovery progression over the next several quarters,\u201d he added.For the fourth quarter, the analyst forecast revenue and earnings per share of $6.1 billion and $0.77, respectively, roughly in line with the consensus.On valuation, DeSilva said the $125 price target is arrived based on 33 times multiple of the calendar year 2024 earnings per share estimate. He said this is at a premium versus the 26 multiple for the overall technology sector, adding that the valuation is justified, given AMD\u2019s relative growth opportunity.AMD Price Action: In pre-market trading on Tuesday, AMD stock rose 0.33% to $117.17, according to Benzinga Pro data.

            "title": "PCs and cars are the future for this giant but little-known chip-designer",
            "description": "Growth opportunities for Arm Holdings  look strong despite stiff headwinds.\u201cAt the heart of every smartphone today is a chip based on Arm technology, including those from Apple and Samsung.\u201d One of the world\u2019s most important technology companies is also one of the least discussed. Arm Holdings ARM, -2.77% is a U.K.-based company founded in 1990 that has been the silent leader in the expansion of computing outside the world of servers and PCs. If you have a smartphone, a connected appliance, a smart TV, or digital home assistant, your personal technology has Arm at its core. Arm has an interesting business history. It was purchased by the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank Group 9984, +1.48% in 2016, had an acquisition attempt in 2020 from Nvidia NVDA, +0.41% that failed regulatory hurdles, and finally went back to being a publicly traded company on Nasdaq last Septmber. Arm just announced its first quarterly earnings report after its IPO, with the market generally pleased with the past three months of revenue but wary of the guidance given for the next quarter. In my view, there are good reasons to believe that Arm has great years ahead of it with expansion into new markets and new revenue streams, but also a few headwinds that put long-term growth at risk.Arm is most often associated with the explosion of the smartphone market, and for good reason. With few exceptions, at the heart of every smartphone today is a chip based on Arm technology, including those from Apple AAPL, +0.66% and Samsung 005930, +0.83%. While the handset space has been problematic for companies recently with the softness of sales in China, indications are that the region is picking back up, with a note from Qualcomm QCOM, -0.26% in its latest earnings to underscore that point. A reinvigorated smartphone market, with the help of on-device AI adoption, will improve the outlook where the company\u2019s largest revenue stream is tied. There are many areas of growth for Arm outside of the smartphone market. The PC space is getting active, as Qualcomm announced a new Snapdragon processor last month that\u2019s meant to displace Intel INTC, +5.92% and AMD AMD, +1.61%. Qualcomm\u2019s new Oryon core powering the chip is based on Arm architecture. And recent rumors of Nvidia and AMD entering into the Windows-on-Arm chip market gives Arm yet another avenue. As the automotive market becomes more about computing and assisted driving, Arm-based products are going to be at the heart of that transition. Qualcomm is one of the leaders in this space as well, mostly utilizing Arm technology. But other Arm partners including NXP Semiconductors NXPI, +0.06%, Renesas Electronics 6723, +4.77% and Cadence Design Systems CDNS, +1.05% are involved in the rollout of automotive technologies from advanced driver-assistance systems to digital cockpits, and all are integrating Arm processors of some kind. This segment is expected to grow at close to a 10% CAGR for at least the next five years and offers a significant revenue opportunity. \u201cMore than 7.1 billion devices shipped this past quarter with Arm technology inside them.\u201d Crucially, Arm has also made progress in the data center segment with its Neoverse family of IP that is targeted at powering cloud- and edge server infrastructure. As more data centers look to find ways to improve or maintain performance while lowering fixed costs of power and space, the advantages that Arm CPUs have in efficiency and scalability shine. And while the data center segment has a been a target for Arm since before the AI revolution, its significant partnership with Nvidia, the clear leader in the enterprise AI race, means that Arm-based products like the Nvidia Grace CPU will drive revenue and relevancy. Read: Big tech is battling to put AI on your PC, laptop and smartphoneIn its most recent earnings report, Arm said that more than 7.1 billion devices had shipped this past quarter with Arm technology inside them. That\u2019s a stunning number and one that tells you how deeply embedded and how pervasive the Arm architecture is in our connected world. We aren\u2019t just talking about companies like Apple, Qualcomm, and Samsung, but also Toshiba 6502, -0.02%, NXP, and Tata Communications 500483, +1.35%. Even Intel and AMD are utilizing Arm designs for some portion of their product lines. Moreover, Arm CEO Rene Haas mentioned in a recent interview with CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer that the strong increase in licensing revenue that Arm saw in this quarter\u2019s earnings report is a \u201cstrong indicator for R&D investment.\u201d This is good news for Arm \u2014 the more product development that is happening today on its IP means that future products released to market will be based on that R&D work, cycling back to more revenue and market share for Arm.Perhaps the biggest risk to Arm is competition. Not from the world of x86 processors that are trying to not be displaced by Arm designs, but by another low power architecture. RISC-V (pronounced \u201crisk five\u201d) is a competing instruction set architecture (ISA). That basically means it is based on a different set of computer microinstructions, not compatible with either Arm or x86 designs. RISC-V is an \u201copen\u201d design, meaning that, at least in theory, it is free to utilize for both academic and commercial use cases. This is obviously an advantage over the Arm architecture, where companies must pay a licensing or royalty fee to design their own Arm CPU or to use one of the cores designed by Arm itself. This openness also means that companies and the RISC-V community are encouraged to share best practices for designs, improving performance and time-to-market. Many tech companies are already using RISC-V for some of their platforms. For example, Qualcomm\u2019s Lu Dai sits on the RISC-V board, as does Nvidia\u2019s Frans Sijstermans. Qualcomm announced a RISC-V based wearable platform, and Alphabet\u2019s Google GOOGL, +1.62% announced OS support for it.How big is this existential risk to Arm? The truth is that migrating or building a RISC-V core is a very heavy engineering lift. Though I don\u2019t have specifics on pricing, if a customer is going to license a core based on RISC-V from a company like SiFive, one of the primary advantages over Arm (cost) seems to fall away. Arm should take this risk to its business model seriously, and it appears to be doing so. There have been shifts in programs offered by the company including a \u201cflexible access\u201d model that offers no-cost access to Arm IP for companies that are in the startup stage, clearly targeting many potential customers of the RISC-V ecosystem.The other big risk for Arm is finding a way to get credit and recognition for its value in the tech space. Much better-known companies such as Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm themselves struggle to maintain brand recognition and brand value as a component company in the products and services that people use every day. Qualcomm makes the modem in almost every flagship smartphone today, and Intel powers 75%+ of the laptops sold each year, but few consumers recognize that fact or even care. Arm is even one more step removed from that; its designs, for example, power the Snapdragon processors that enable flagship Samsung handsets. Getting credit for that enabling work, from the investor market as well as the consumer (and to some degree a share of wallet) is a difficult task. These headwinds aside, the next five years and beyond for Arm look strong. It\u2019s leadership in the smartphone market likely will not be challenged and the areas of growth, from PCs to AI to cars, offer significant revenue upside.

            "title": "Nvidia\u2019s stock notches longest winning streak in seven years, with all-time high in view",
            "description": "Shares are hovering roughly 1% below their all-time closing high of $493.55, which was achieved Aug. 31.Nvidia Corp. shares on Monday secured their longest winning streak in nearly seven years as they hovered near their all-time high. The chip giant earlier Monday introduced its new artificial-intelligence chip, promising significant performance improvements relative to the prior model. The H200 is the first graphics-processing unit from Nvidia NVDA, +0.41% to feature HBM3e memory, giving it more bandwidth and capacity and highlighting \u201cthe importance of memory in next-gen AI workloads,\u201d according to Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers. Nvidia \u201chas not refreshed prior datacenter GPUs in the past, so this represents further evidence of [Nvidia] accelerating their product cadence in response to AI market growth and performance requirements, which further expands their competitive moat,\u201d Wolfe Research analyst Chris Caso noted.Shares of Nvidia rose 0.6% in Monday trading to notch their ninth session in a row of gains. That made for the stock\u2019s longest winning streak since Dec. 27, 2016, when it rose for 10 trading days in a row, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The stock has advanced more than 19% during the current nine-session stretch. Opinion: This Nvidia partner has seen its stock surge 200% this year. But investors may be overlooking a risk.Nvidia shares, which closed Monday at $486.20, are hovering 1.5% below their all-time closing high of $493.55, which was achieved Aug. 31.Mizuho desk-based analyst Jordan Klein weighed in Monday on Nvidia\u2019s rally over the past week, writing that the gains in shares of Nvidia, Broadcom Inc.

Learn MoreAn economic downturn caused the Nasdaq Composite index to plunge 33% in 2022. Tech companies were some of the hardest hit as spikes in inflation led to reductions in consumer and commercial spending. The PC market experienced steep declines in sales. Meanwhile, e-commerce businesses struggled to attract shoppers. The challenging period illustrated why it's crucial to hold tech stocks during market dips.The Nasdaq Composite index has risen 32% in 2023, largely taking back what it lost. As a result, investors who sold in 2022 will not have benefited from the recovery many tech stocks have enjoyed this year. An economic slump is often an excellent time to fill up on tech stocks at bargain prices and reap the rewards over the long term.Despite recent market growth, macroeconomic hurdles have continued to plague many tech companies this year. As a potential recession looms, it's a good idea to know what stocks to buy in a sell-off.So, here are two top tech stocks to buy during a recession.Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 1.74%) proved particularly vulnerable to economic declines last year as its shares tumbled 55% throughout 2022. PC market challenges caused a consumer pullback, which led AMD's client segment to report a 10% decrease in revenue in fiscal 2022 after a reduction in central processing unit (CPU) sales. However, AMD appears to be back on a growth path. Its shares have climbed 83% since Jan. 1, with Wall Street rallying over the company's prospects in the budding artificial intelligence (AI) market. As a leading chipmaker, AMD has a powerful position in tech by supplying its hardware to companies across multiple markets. AMD's chips can be found powering laptops, custom-built PCs, video game consoles, cloud platforms, and AI models. As a result, its stock allows investors the chance to profit from the development of several high-growth industries over the long term.AMD's diversified business model makes it an attractive option during a recession. Last year's economic downturn saw its shares plummet, yet its stock has soared this year thanks to advances in tech. Over the last five years, AMD's stock has risen 460%. Meanwhile, the company has exciting plans to challenge Nvidia's dominance in AI next year with the launch of a new chip, which could offer another boost to its revenue and share price.AMD has a solid long-term outlook, and its stock is a must-buy in a market sell-off or recession.Amazon (AMZN -0.70%) is another company that was hit hard last year. Its shares plunged 50% over the 12 months as its e-commerce segment reported operating losses totaling $10.6 billion in fiscal 2022. Amazon suffered from steep declines in retail sales. However, the company reacted quickly, restructuring its business by closing dozens of warehouses, shuttering unprofitable projects, and laying off thousands of workers.Management's changes have clearly paid off, with Amazon's North America segment hitting over $4 billion in operating income in the third quarter of 2023. The figure is a massive improvement from the $412 million in losses it reported in the year-ago quarter and proves that Amazon is a business worth an investment thanks to strong leadership.In addition to a return to profitability in its retail business, Amazon is heavily investing in AI through its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). The tech giant has introduced several new AI tools to AWS this year as it strives to meet soaring demand for such services.Meanwhile, CEO Andy Jassy announced in June the company would soon diversify its role in AI by venturing into chip development. AWS has produced two new AI chips and promises to offer the best price-to-performance in the industry as it goes up against the likes of Nvidia and AMD.Amazon is dominating two lucrative areas of tech with its online marketplace and AWS, which will likely provide significant gains over the long term. So it's not surprising that 52 out of 53 analysts have rated Amazon's stock a strong buy, with its average 12-month price target set at $173 (projecting stock growth of 21%). The company's business might be vulnerable in a recession, but that is the best time to invest in this tech giant and profit from its inevitable recovery.John Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool\u2019s board of directors.

Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn MoreAMD (AMD 1.69%) just had a messy third quarter 2023, but generative artificial intelligence (AI) once again stole the spotlight and sent shares of the chip designer higher. The stock has doubled since bottoming during the bear market just over a year ago.But how much hype is really warranted for AMD? After all, this top chip stock also carries a high valuation, and there's a lot more going on under the hood than AI.AMD has been around for decades, has survived multiple economic downturns for the cyclical semiconductor industry, and come roaring back each time -- particularly in its run over the decade-plus following the great financial crisis of 2008-2009, and AMD's parting of ways with its manufacturing business GlobalFoundries. But this coming up cycle for chips is different. One standout quote from AMD CEO Lisa Su on the last earnings call regarding its new AI chip, the Instinct MI300, had investors feeling optimistic: Based on the rapid progress we are making with our AI road map execution and purchase commitments from cloud customers, we now expect Data Center GPU revenue to be approximately $400 million in the fourth quarter [of 2023] and exceed $2 billion in 2024 as revenue ramps throughout the year. This growth would make MI300 the fastest product to ramp to $1 billion in sales in AMD history.Don't get me wrong, I'm an AMD shareholder too, and \"fastest growing chip in AMD history\" sounds pretty good. But let's put it in context. Total data center revenue was $1.6 billion last quarter, flat year over year (but better than chief rival Intel's 10% year-over-year data center sales decline to $3.8 billion). The rub here is that there's a lot more to the \"data center\" segment than AI chips. After booming cloud computing growth the last few years, the bulk of AMD's sales (primarily from EPYC CPUs and adaptive systems-on-chip), big data center operators are reallocating budgets to generative AI GPUs.This obviously favors Nvidia right now, which has been reporting booming data center sales (over $10.3 billion in its last reported quarter alone) as new infrastructure to support generative AI is soaring. And meanwhile, that has the bulk of AMD's data center business in decline, so AI is merely offsetting that \"old\" data center infrastructure weakness.Additionally, there's a growing downturn in other pockets of the semiconductor space. Communications and industrial markets (AMD's \"embedded\" segment, primarily from the early 2022 acquisition of Xilinx) also fell 5% year over year after a stellar run. Gaming sales, tied to the ongoing downturn in consumer electronics spending, were also down 8%.The lone star in Q3 then was the \"client\" segment, primarily CPUs for the bludgeoned PC and laptop market. Peak to trough, \"client\" sales went from $2.2 billion in Q2 2022 to a mere $739 million in Q1 2023 before making a gradual rebound back to $1.5 billion in Q3 2023. Until 2024's anticipated MI300 boom gets underway, it's actually just good old consumer-driven PC sales moving the needle at AMD at the moment.AMD's coming ramp-up of the MI300 sounds promising. Its work to narrow the gap with Nvidia's unified hardware and software platform could begin to pay off, and AMD has other AI chips (like those used in design, emulation, and verification when engineering new chip models) that could also fuel growth next year. All of this should be a nice side car to the coming return of PC and laptop business. Profit margin recovery, especially in that beaten-down \"client\" segment, and overall free-cash-flow generation will be a key focus headed into the new year.Data by YCharts.But setting aside the at least $2 billion in expected data center GPU revenue and the MI300 top-hit next year, there are concerns with the now declining \"embedded\" and non-AI data center business. We don't know how much longer these downturns will last, and how deep they'll get. That's a headwind for AMD, and a drawback to being a big diversified chip company, especially after the Xilinx tie-up.AMD stock trades for 30 times Wall Street analysts' expectations for 2024 earnings per share, and 36 times expected free cash flow. It isn't exactly a value, although if AMD is sandbagging on those AI expectations, perhaps estimates are far too low for next year. At any rate, I'm not so sure AMD is the screaming AI chip stock buy some think it is. I have a position, and I'm content to hold here and wait and see what management's initial 2024 outlook is in a few more months.Nicholas Rossolillo has positions in Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia.

Learn MoreGamers are projected to spend $250 billion on video game products in 2023, with that figure forecast to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 10% through 2027 (per Statista). The industry hit some roadblocks over the last year as macroeconomic headwinds led to reductions in consumer spending. However, video games remain a lucrative market over the long term, thanks to consistent demand for new content and upgraded hardware.A recent market slump could make now an excellent time to invest in this ever-expanding industry, with stocks likely to soar once economic challenges subside. While video game giants like Sony and Microsoft might seem like obvious investment choices, some lesser-known game companies could offer bigger gains as their gaming divisions develop.Here are two under-the-radar gaming stocks you can buy and hold for the next decade.Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 1.69%) captured Wall Street's attention this year, with its shares up 80% since Jan. 1. The company rallied investors by expanding into the budding artificial intelligence (AI) market, gearing up to challenge Nvidia in 2024 by launching a new chip. However, long before AMD's recent pivot to AI, the company had a powerful position in video games.The tech giant's computing components, such as central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs), have been popular among PC gamers for years. Consumers use AMD's hardware to build custom gaming machines that run games at far higher settings than possible on a console. AMD's success in the space has seen its annual revenue skyrocket 264% over the last five years, with operating income up 180%. In addition to the PC market, AMD has a promising position in consoles. The company is the exclusive supplier of chips to Sony's PlayStation 5 and Microsoft's Xbox Series X|S, which have sold more than 60 million units combined since launching in 2020. Both of these consoles are due for a mid-generation upgrade, which could offer AMD another boost to sales over the next year.As a leading chipmaker, AMD is crucial to the future of gaming and multiple other tech markets. Its expansion into AI is pushing its chips forward, which could make it more competitive in video games over the long term. The company is on a lucrative growth trajectory, making this stock an attractive investment to buy now and hold for the long term.Amazon (AMZN -0.70%) might not be the first company that comes to mind in a discussion about gaming, but it has gradually carved out a solid role in the industry.The tech giant acquired Twitch, the world's biggest livestreaming platform for gamers, in 2014. The service has blown up under Amazon, with revenue rising over 200% between 2018 and 2022. Twitch sales hit $2.8 billion last year while averaging 7.6 billion monthly users, far exceeding Alphabet's YouTube Gaming and Meta Platforms' Facebook Gaming.Moreover, Amazon's dominance in e-commerce has made it one of the biggest video game retailers on the planet. Data from Statista shows Amazon was responsible for 66% of all video game purchases in the U.S. as of June 2023, outperforming Best Buy, GameStop, and Walmart. Amazon's potent e-commerce website has made it the go-to for anyone looking to buy new titles or consoles, suggesting the company has much to gain as the market develops.Amazon's expansion into gaming hasn't stopped at livestreaming and retail -- it's trying its hand at game development through Amazon Games. The company has seen blips of success in the sector with popular titles Lost Ark and New World. However, Amazon still has a long way to go before becoming a leading game developer. But with $50 billion in cash and cash equivalents in its latest quarter (the third quarter of 2023), the company has the financial resources to continue investing in the market. Amazon is a behemoth in the tech world, with significant market shares in e-commerce, cloud computing, AI, and even aspects of gaming. The company's shares have soared 69% year to date, as management has brought its e-commerce business back to profitability and put it on a promising growth path. With Twitch, video game retail sales, and a slowly growing development division, Amazon is an excellent under-the-radar gaming stock to consider buying this month and holding for the next decade.Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

            "title": "These tech stocks scored this earnings season even as AI hype slowed -- and the winner may surprise you",
            "description": "Microsoft proves its strength; Qualcomm may have turned a corner.The hype around artificial intelligence was taken down a notch in the third quarter, as Big Tech companies came under pressure to show results in what has become the largest technological shift since the creation of the internet. The upshot of last quarter\u2019s earnings reports was that there\u2019s steady and significant spending on AI, even as there are signs the U.S. economy is slowing amid high interest rates. Companies with the most exposure to AI are catching a tailwind that I expect will last for years, perhaps even for well over a decade.Microsoft MSFT, +1.54% proved it\u2019s the strongest of the group, with better-than-expected revenue, higher margins and a reacceleration in its Azure cloud unit. On the other side of the spectrum, a beleaguered Qualcomm QCOM, -0.25% emerged from a difficult year and raised its guidance, suggesting the maker of chips for handsets and PCs has turned the corner. AI stories are everywhere, especially at semiconductor companies that are powering this new computing revolution. But a good read on the adoption of the technology can be seen in less visible companies, including IBM IBM, -0.04% and ServiceNow NOW, +0.02%. Both are gaining momentum, ensuring ever-stronger competition in Big Tech. \u201cMicrosoft is the biggest company investor in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT.\u201d Here\u2019s my Big Tech review for the companies above as well as for Meta Platforms META, +0.06%, Amazon.com AMZN AMZN, -0.60%, Intel INTC, +5.95% and Apple AAPL, +0.66%. Microsoft: Microsoft is the clear frontrunner in AI-focused Big Tech, driven by its strong monetization and adoption narrative. In the third quarter, it showcased robust results across many metrics, and strong performance was fueled by AI and cloud services. Microsoft is the biggest company investor in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT.Total revenue rose 13% to $56.5 billion from a year earlier, almost $2 billion more than expected by analysts. Azure, Microsoft\u2019s enterprise cloud unit, posted an acceleration in revenue growth, to 29%, compared with 26% in the previous quarter, allaying concerns companies are moderating spending. Microsoft, despite its $2.6 trillion market value, is still growing quickly for a company this big. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s getting more profitable. Gross margins widened to 71%, up 2 percentage points. And operating margins jumped by 5 percentage points to 48%. Qualcomm: The chip designer exceeded expectations in the third quarter and raised its guidance, indicating momentum in China and strength in most sectors except internet of things (IoT). The new forecast is for revenue of as high as $9.9 billion in the current quarter. In a recent conversation with CEO Cristiano Amon, he expressed confidence in Qualcomm\u2019s strength, highlighting positive revenue growth from Chinese manufacturers and significant growth in the automotive business. He said smartphone makers have worked through most of their inventory and are starting to place orders again. Boosting investor confidence, Qualcomm signed a new supply agreement with Apple in September.While Amon is cautious, the overall sentiment surrounding Qualcomm is brightening, with Qualcomm entering recovery mode. This is one to watch.Read: Qualcomm\u2019s newest laptop chips hit Intel, AMD and Apple with a powerful punchIBM: IBM, steady under CEO Arvind Krishna, posted revenue of $14.75 billion in the third quarter, up 4.6% and beating estimates. The company\u2019s focus on AI was evident, with notable software and consulting wins. Revenue in the software segment, which includes AI, rose 7.8% to $6.3 billion. Customers are increasingly opting for the Watson X AI platform, the CEO said on a conference call with analysts. The company also confirmed its previous full-year guidance for revenue and cash flow growth. Speaking with CFO Jim Kavanaugh, it was evident that the overall, IBM performance was marked by operational efficiency and margin expansion, but also confidence that the company\u2019s AI and hybrid cloud strategies are meeting the company\u2019s revenue and margin expectations, indicating the company\u2019s strategic approach in navigating the evolving tech landscape is working. ServiceNow: ServiceNow showcased consistent growth in simplifying complex software environments with its AI-powered Now platform. The company is operating at a $10 billion annual rate, a milestone, having posted accelerating revenue growth for the third straight quarter. I spoke to CEO Bill McDermott on earnings day. Beyond the results, he emphasized efficiency gains, significant customer wins and a positive reception for the company\u2019s Vancouver platform, which embeds generative AI across all workflows. McDermott said in an interview with MarketWatch\u2019s sister publication Barron\u2019s that he expects increases in spending on IT to double to 7% as companies fear being left behind. They will make cuts elsewhere to pay for AI software, he said.Meta Platforms: Meta is spending heavily on AI and mixed reality. CFO Susan Li said in the third-quarter report that she expects operating losses to rise meaningfully at Reality Labs, a research unit that works on AI, machine learning, neural control interface and full body tracking. On the bright side, the number of daily and monthly active users in various categories all rose during the quarter, by up to 7%. Advertising revenue jumped 24% to $33.6 billion, more than twice the pace of rival Alphabet GOOG, +1.58%. Amazon\u2019s ad revenue increased slightly faster, by 26%, though the total amount in dollar terms is almost one-third that of Meta. Meta\u2019s investments in AI are aimed at giving retailers improved targeted ads. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said increases in time spent on Facebook and Instagram are a result of \u201cour recommendation improvements.\u201d Amazon: Amazon delivered a mixed performance in the third quarter. Revenue at the closely watched AWS cloud unit climbed 12%, slightly below expectations. In contrast, growth at Microsoft\u2019s competing business, Azure, was 29%, and it was 22% at Google Cloud. Still, AWS is materially larger than its chief rivals.A closely watched gauge at Amazon is profit margins, which widened for the third consecutive quarter as CEO Andy Jassy\u2019s austerity program pays off. Operating margins came in at 7.8%, the highest in more than two years. They had fallen to as low as 1.8% in the fourth quarter of 2022. Jassy cited AWS\u2019s innovation in generative AI, emphasizing momentum with notable clients including Adidas, Booking.com and Merck.Intel: Intel exhibited overall strength in the third quarter, surpassing expectations despite tough macro conditions and competition from chip powerhouse Nvidia NVDA, +0.42% (Nvidia is slated to release quarterly earnings on Nov. 21.) and AMD AMD, +1.60%, which recently forecasted a mega data-center AI number despite coming out with conservative guidance, which led to a mixed market response. While year-over-year growth in core businesses didn\u2019t meet ideal levels, Intel demonstrated improvement and CEO Pat Gelsinger expressed optimism about the company\u2019s progress. Intel\u2019s focus on AI-powered PCs and datacenter AI, coupled with outsized growth in the foundry segment, positions the company well for future opportunities. Still, datacenter AI needs to produce faster growth. In a conversation I had with Gelsinger, we discussed the critical importance of the AI opportunity and I sense he sees a tangible opportunity that should materialize for Intel as AI shifts to inference, where CPUs and accelerators will be more prevalent, playing to Intel\u2019s strengths. Let\u2019s say this: Intel still has some work to do.Apple: The headlines on Apple earnings are dominated by the fact that the company has posted four straight quarterly declines in revenue. That, no doubt, is important. Having said that, Apple could teach master classes in managing its sprawling operations. Operating margins climbed two percentage points to 30% in a slowing economy. Plus, revenue came in as expected, and earnings were better than expected. The new iPhone cycle hasn\u2019t been all that exciting, and the new M3 chip isn\u2019t as compelling as one thought it might be. And while declines in revenue may make some say this wasn\u2019t a good quarter, I\u2019ll argue that these results coupled with strong services growth \u2014 up 16% \u2014 makes for an overall decent report. We all knew the hardware party wouldn\u2019t last forever \u2014 this temporary downturn in devices is pushing Apple to innovate on services and drive-up margins, which will be good for the company and its investors long term.

Learn MoreShares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM -0.19%), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 1.79%), and Broadcom (AVGO -1.94%) were on the rise Friday, appreciating 6.2%, 4.8%, and 4.7%, respectively, as of 2:14 p.m. ET.The semiconductor industry has been in a downturn for most of 2023, with investors wondering when the sector will recover, and also what the trajectory of that recovery would be.Today, TSMC reported its monthly October revenue, which surprised to the upside. Given that TSMC is the largest chip foundry in the world, and that AMD and Broadcom are big clients of TSMC, they rose too in a terrific day for semiconductor stocks broadly.In October, TSMC reported revenue of 243.2 billion Taiwanese dollars, up a whopping 34.8% just over the prior quarter. And even relative to last year's October, revenue was up 15.7%. For the full 10 months of 2023 through October, revenue is now down slightly at (3.7%). But that's a big improvement; at the end of September, revenue for the year had been down (6.2%).On its recent conference call, TSMC had guided that full-year revenue would be down in the high single digits or thereabouts. And even earlier in the year, TSMC had guided that full-year revenue would be down close to 10%. So, today's update seems to indicate the semi cycle may be recovering quicker than thought. While TSMC has had a tailwind from artificial intelligence demand this year, specifically Nvidia (NVDA 0.45%) GPUs, TSMC management had noted earlier in the year that AI chips only made up a single-digit proportion of its revenue.So, while AI chip demand is no doubt surging right now -- as most everyone knows -- it seems like other markets such as phones and PCs may be starting to turn up as well. In addition, automotive and industrial chips have been thought to be weakening recently, as demand growth for EVs has waned. However, the downturn is perhaps not as bad as feared.There's also the possibility that other AI chips besides Nvidia's H100s are starting their ramp as well. On AMD's own recent earnings release, CEO Lisa Su anticipated some $400 million in fourth-quarter revenue for the company's new MI300 AI accelerator, which she projects rocketing to over $2 billion in sales next year.Meanwhile, Broadcom is also a large client of TSMC's, and it rose despite continued delays of its acquisition of VMware. Broadcom is also benefiting from AI acceleration, as its data center switching and routing platforms are gaining adoption for the lightning-fast connections needed in AI training clusters.Investors in semiconductor stocks have done very well over the long term in general, but many don't invest in the sector because of the inherent cyclicality, which causes ecstatic booms and nauseating busts. That has led to many semiconductor stock valuations that aren't actually that demanding. For instance, TSMC, the outright leader in semiconductor manufacturing, trades at just 17 times trailing earnings, even after today's surge.Yet semiconductors power all modern applications, from the PC to the smartphone to the cloud to artificial intelligence and autonomous cars. So all growth investors with long time horizons should have at least some exposure to the sector. This is especially true as we are about to come up on the one-year anniversary of the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot. With basically all big tech and chip companies now racing to enter the AI market, it still seems like we are in the early innings of the AI wave.Based on TSMC's numbers, it appears we could be entering the next up cycle with force.Billy Duberstein has positions in Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.

AMD management expressed high confidence in its $2 billion outlook for MI300 in 2024 and its ability to compete with Nvidia Corp NVDA, particularly on inferencing. AMD has good visibility into the ramp of MI300X next year, given seven- to eight-month lead times and POs in hand with firm visibility through the first half of FY24.AMD indicated it is incredibly competitive on inferencing, given its higher HBM content. The upside to the $2 billion appears likely as AMD indicated it is not supply-constrained on its $2 billion outlook and has enough supply to support the upside. AMD provided additional color related to its over $2 billion GPU revenue target for 2024. AMD expects the share gain story of server CPU to continue, with strong Bergamo traction at Meta Platforms Inc META. While Intel Corp INTC has recently shown progress on the upcoming 18A process, AMD remains confident in the partnership with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co TSM and its manufacturing edges, from wafers to packaging. AMD projects the industry units to grow LSD% or flat, with ASP being a more significant driver of TAM growth. With PC correction largely behind, AMD sees continued share gains in NB and the launches of AI PCs to support 2024 growth. For PCs, with sell-in essentially matching sell-through now, AMD sees 1Q tracking more in line with seasonal trends while projecting to continue to gain share in 2024, particularly NB.

While fears of an economic downturn triggered a dramatic sell-off in tech stocks in 2022, the artificial intelligence (AI) boom has reignited investor optimism in 2023. Countless tech companies' stocks have surged this year, with their gains primarily driven by their prospects in AI.The launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT late last year highlighted how far the technology had come, with the potential to advance numerous industries, from consumer products to healthcare, manufacturing, education, and more. According to Grand View Research, the AI market hit $137 billion in 2022 and is projected to expand at a compound annual rate of 37% through 2030. Even as many companies have pivoted their businesses to AI development this year, the sector still has much to offer new investors. As the proverb goes, \"The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second-best time is now.\" It's not too late to profit substantially from this budding market, and there's no time like the present.So, here are three top artificial intelligence stocks to buy right now.The debut of ChatGPT sent Nvidia shares skyrocketing thanks to its lucrative role as primary supplier of the chips that allow the platform to operate. However, its success also highlighted how far behind Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 1.74%) had fallen in AI. As a result, AMD has doubled down on its AI expansion in 2023, making various acquisitions and developing the technology needed to challenge Nvidia's dominance next year.The company will begin shipping what it calls its most powerful graphics process unit (GPU) ever in 2024, a chip meant to compete directly with Nvidia's offerings. AMD has big hopes for the new chip as the market is in desperate need of competition. AI-minded companies have been calling for alternatives to Nvidia's chips for months as more options and supply should reduce the cost of AI chips.In AMD's third-quarter earnings call on Oct. 31, CEO Lisa Su said that the company expects to hit about $400 million in data center GPU revenue in Q4. However, it projects that figure will exceed $2 billion in 2024 as its AI chip sales soar. AMD has massive potential in AI over the long term, and its stock is a compelling option ahead of the company's AI chip launch.Microsoft (MSFT 1.67%) has emerged as one of the most exciting AI companies this year, and offers arguably the most earnings potential in the industry over the long term. It was an early investor in AI, sinking $1 billion into OpenAI in 2019. Microsoft has since increased that figure by $10 billion, taking a 49% stake in the start-up. OpenAI's technology, paired with potent Microsoft brands such as Office and Azure, could be a winning combination that presents endless earning opportunities. As businesses and consumers increasingly look for ways to boost efficiency with the help of AI, Microsoft could become a go-to provider as it continues to add AI tools across its popular product lineup.The tech giant is already seeing promising growth thanks to AI. In its fiscal 2024 first quarter, which ended in September, Microsoft's revenue increased by 13% year over year, exceeding Wall Street forecasts by close to $2 billion. That rise came alongside a 13% bump in productivity revenue and a 19% increase in cloud sales.Microsoft is gradually making moves to monetize its AI expansion and has solid prospects with the millions of users its services attract and access to OpenAI's AI models.Like AMD, Amazon (AMZN -0.70%) started the year on the back foot. In its case, the challenge was the head start that Microsoft had in AI. However, it has used its vast financial resources and dominance in cloud computing to carve out a powerful position in the AI space.Amazon owns the world's biggest cloud infrastructure platform with Amazon Web Services (AWS), serving prominent clientele such as Meta Platforms, Sony, and Netflix. Meanwhile, it is rapidly expanding its AI cloud services, adding a range of new tools this year to meet the growing demand for such features.In addition to AI potential in the cloud market, Amazon's research in the industry will likely offer a boost to its e-commerce business. The company has used AI tools for years for tasks such as tracking shopping trends, recommending products to customers, and improving shipping logistics. Amazon's developing AI tech will likely help the company retain its dominance in online retail and profit from the sector's long-term growth.Amazon is on a promising growth trajectory, outperforming analysts' revenue estimates by more than $1.5 billion in Q3 as sales rose 13% year over year. That growth was primarily provided by the company's North American and international segments, which posted revenue increases of 11% and 16%, respectively. Alongside an expanding venture into AI, the company could be unstoppable in the coming years, and you won't want to miss out.John Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Learn MoreTech stocks have long had a reputation for offering investors significant gains over the long term. The industry is one of the most reliable growth areas, with companies constantly innovating and pushing the sector forward. Meanwhile, consistent consumer demand for upgraded devices and software offers businesses endless opportunities for financial growth.Many of the world's most successful tech companies operate on the Nasdaq rather than alternative U.S. exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The chart below illustrates how the Nasdaq Composite index has grown significantly more over the last five years than the NYSE index. Narrowing it further, the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector has outperformed both indexes, illustrating how lucrative tech stocks can be if held over many years.Data by YCharts.Advances in budding tech markets, such as artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality, cloud computing, and more, suggest the industry will continue to offer patient investors substantial gains. So, here are two top tech stocks to buy for the long haul.Amazon (AMZN -0.70%) has won over Wall Street this year, with its stock up 67% since Jan. 1. The company is on a promising growth trajectory and could be among the best investments for long-term-minded stockholders. Amazon dominates two high-growth areas of tech with its e-commerce and cloud businesses. Meanwhile, the company is making promising inroads in AI.Macroeconomic headwinds caused steep declines in Amazon's retail segments in 2022, which account for over 80% of its revenue. However, various restructuring moves have led to an impressive recovery this year, illustrating the strength of management and the company's long-term earnings potential.In the third quarter of 2023, Amazon's North American segment hit over $4 billion in operating income, a significant turnaround from the $412 million in losses it posted in the year-ago period. The spike in retail profits came alongside a 13% increase in total revenue, beating analyst expectations by over $1.5 billion.The company's e-commerce business is back on track. Meanwhile, it is rapidly expanding its AI offerings on its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services, carving out its place in the budding market.Amazon's long-term outlook is seemingly growing stronger by the day, and Wall Street appears to agree. The company's average 12-month price target is $172, forecasting stock growth of 24%. Amazon has massive potential in the coming years as e-commerce and AI continue to expand, with its stock a screaming buy right now.All eyes have been on chipmakers this year as expansions in sectors such as AI and cloud computing have highlighted how crucial chips are to the future of tech. These companies are powering devices and various software platforms across the industry and have much to gain as tech develops.Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 1.74%) shares have climbed 73% year to date, rallying investors with plans to make a big splash in AI in 2024. The company is gearing up to challenge Nvidia's dominance by launching a new AI graphics processing unit (GPU). If AMD's chips can offer competitive price-to-performance, revenue could skyrocket next year.CEO Lisa Su revealed in AMD's third-quarter 2023 earnings call that the company expects data center GPU revenue to hit $400 million in Q4 but exceed $2 billion in 2024 as AI GPU sales soar. AI-driven companies have been calling for increased competition in the market as more options will reduce the cost of AI hardware. AMD has an exciting opportunity to snap up market share in the burgeoning industry and vastly expand its business.AMD shares have risen 13% since posting Q3 2023 results on Oct. 31. The company posted revenue growth of 4% year over year, beating analysts' expectations by $110 million. The tech giant has faced challenges over the last year, burdened by PC market declines. However, AMD has a solid outlook over the long term as it expands its position in AI and continues to supply its chips across tech.As a leading chipmaker, AMD is well-positioned to profit substantially as the tech market develops, making its stock an excellent option to buy for the long haul.John Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn MoreArtificial intelligence (AI) has supercharged semiconductor stocks in 2023, which is not surprising as the proliferation of this technology opened up a whole new revenue opportunity for companies that produce them.After all, the AI chip market is anticipated to generate an eye-popping $304 billion in annual revenue in 2030, according to Next Move Strategy Consulting. That's going to be a big jump over last year's revenue of just less than $29 billion.Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 1.69%) has started scratching the surface of the AI chip opportunity. The company said on its latest earnings conference call that it expects AI chips to contribute $400 million in revenue in the current quarter. In 2024, AMD is currently anticipating $2 billion in AI-fueled revenue.However, AMD made its name as a supplier of chips for personal computers (PCs). AMD's central processing units (CPUs) and graphics cards have been popular among gamers and creators thanks to their ability to run resource-intensive tasks such as games and editing software efficiently. This puts the company in a nice position to make the most of the next big development in the PC market -- AI.The PC market has been depressed as shipments declined big time thanks to weak demand. However, it recently started stabilizing, and market research firm IDC anticipates the PC market to return to growth from 2024. The researcher estimates that PC shipments could increase 3.7% in 2024 to 261.4 million units. What's more, PC shipments are forecasted to clock a compound annual growth rate of 3.1% through 2027.While these growth projections may not seem attractive at first, there is one catalyst in the form of AI that could drive a big upgrade cycle in PCs. According to market research firm Canalys, sales of AI-enabled PCs are expected to take off next year. The firm estimates that 19% of PCs in 2024 will be AI-capable. That figure is expected to jump to 60% by 2027.It is worth noting that nearly all AI services are cloud-driven because of the huge computational power that's required to run them. However, AI applications that can run locally on PCs are also gaining traction. In August of last year, Stability AI launched a service that allows users to generate AI art right on their PCs. Stability AI recommended that users' PCs should have at least 6.9 GB of RAM (random access memory) for the application to work.However, Stability AI's application reportedly requires a lot of computing power and takes a toll on a computer's system memory, graphics card, and RAM. Also, creating AI art through Stability AI's offering is a time-consuming process, as generating a single low-resolution image can take 10 minutes if you don't have a powerful enough PC.Given that there are many other AI apps apart from Stability AI that users can install on their PCs, it wouldn't be surprising to see consumers spending money on more powerful chips such as CPUs and graphics cards so that they can run them more efficiently on their computers. This could open up a solid opportunity for AMD to increase sales, and the company is already making moves to capitalize on this opportunity.AMD CEO Lisa Su said on the company's latest earnings conference call:In PCs, there are now more than 50 notebook designs powered by Ryzen AI in the market, and we are working closely with Microsoft on the next generation of Windows that will take advantage of our on-chip AI Engine to enable the biggest advances in the Windows user experience in more than 20 years.Su added that sales of AMD's Ryzen 7000 CPUs, which come equipped with an AI accelerator, have increased significantly. The company was among the first to integrate AI accelerators on its PC CPUs, which explains why AMD has been able to deploy a good number of laptops with some level of AI functionality into the market.More importantly, it looks like this strategy has led to a sharp turnaround in AMD's client processor business, which was earlier struggling on account of weak PC demand.The company's revenue from selling PC processors increased an impressive 42% year over year to $1.5 billion in the third quarter of 2023. For comparison, PC shipments were down 7.6% year over year during the quarter, according to IDC, which means AMD outperformed the end-market by a wide margin.The PC market is set to start growing once again from next year, and AI could encourage users to upgrade their CPUs so that they can run compatible apps easily, suggesting that AMD's client processor business may be able to sustain its impressive momentum. That bodes well for the company's overall performance, as this segment produced 26% of its total revenue last quarter.Moreover, the improvement in the PC market and AMD's growing prominence in AI chips are expected to drive a big turnaround in its fortunes in 2024.AMD EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YChartsAnalysts are anticipating AMD's earnings to drop from $3.50 per share in 2022 to $2.60 per share this year. The chart above points toward a significant acceleration in the company's bottom-line performance.Investors have started buying this semiconductor stock hand over fist, which is evident from the 16% jump in its share price since it released its Q3 report on Oct. 31. This seems like the smart thing to do, as AMD's bright prospects could lead to a stronger financial performance and healthy stock upside.Harsh Chauhan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn MoreThe stock market has suffered a persistent decline over the last few months with the benchmark S&P 500 index sinking 10% between Aug. 1 and Oct. 27. Here's why:Image source: Getty Images.The S&P 500 is coming off its best week of 2023 with a sizzling gain of 5.9%. What changed so quickly?The start of November brought an end to the period of seasonal weakness, and mutual funds' Oct. 31 deadline for tax loss selling officially passed. Plus, the U.S. Federal Reserve held interest rates steady at its meeting last week, and chairman Jerome Powell was slightly less hawkish than investors expected. In fact, experts are now anticipating three interest rate cuts in 2024.Those factors were enough to springboard the S&P 500 higher. But some individual stocks performed even better last week, because there was another catalyst at play: They reported their latest quarterly financial results. Here are two stocks that topped the S&P 500, and why investors should buy them now.Amazon (AMZN -0.70%) is the world's leading e-commerce company, and that part of its business played a key role in the company's strong financial results for the third quarter. However, Amazon also received crucial contributions from its industry-leading cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and its digital advertising segment.Amazon generated $57.2 billion in online sales during the quarter, marking a 7% increase from the year-ago period. That was the fastest growth rate of 2023 so far. Consumers are likely shopping with Amazon for its cheap prices as they grapple with higher interest rates, but the company has also streamlined its retail operations across the U.S. to speed up delivery times and increase convenience for customers.AWS, which is Amazon's most profitable segment, generated $23.1 billion in revenue. That represented growth of 12%, which halted the decelerating growth the cloud platform experienced coming into the quarter. Some of that strength was attributable to Amazon's investments in artificial intelligence (AI) on both the hardware and software sides, which could be a substantial growth driver going forward.Investors have also been watching Amazon's advertising segment with a high degree of interest. The company continues to expand its portfolio of digital assets, like its Prime, Twitch, and Amazon Music streaming services, which are creating new opportunities to sell ads. Starting in 2024, Amazon will introduce video ads on Prime for the first time to help monetize its estimated 200 million users. Advertising was Amazon's fastest growing segment in Q3 with revenue jumping 25% to $12.1 billion.In total, Amazon reported $143.1 billion of revenue for Q3, up 13% and higher than the Wall St. consensus. But Amazon's profitability was the real surprise with its $11.2 billion in operating income representing a whopping 343% year-over-year jump. That proved the company's efforts to cut costs and improve efficiency over the last 12 months are working.Ultimately, Amazon appears to be experiencing an upswing across all of its core businesses, which is why investors sent its shares surging 8.5% last week. But it certainly isn't too late to buy the stock.Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 1.74%) is one of the world's leading producers of semiconductors (chips). Its hardware is used in a long list of popular consumer electronics, from the Sony PlayStation 5 to the infotainment systems in Tesla's electric vehicles.Rising interest rates and tough economic conditions have resulted in consumers buying fewer big-ticket electronics like computers and game consoles over the past year. In the first six months of 2023, revenue in AMD's client segment (which sells chips to computer and device manufacturers) plunged 54% year over year. However, it bounced back with an impressive 42% growth rate in the third quarter.It was the strongest of AMD's four key business segments in Q3, and it was driven by the company's new Ryzen AI line of chips, which are designed to transform computers, notebooks, and devices into artificial intelligence-enabled powerhouses. They will help users process AI workloads on-device, as opposed to in the cloud, which means faster response times and a better experience.However, investors are now keenly focused on AMD's data center segment. While revenue was flat in Q3, the company is on the cusp of shipping large volumes of its new MI300 series of chips designed for AI workloads, which will directly compete with Nvidia's industry-leading hardware. AMD expects the MI300 range to contribute a whopping $2 billion (at least) to its data center revenue in 2024, once production and sales ramp up, which was music to investors' ears.AMD's total revenue came in at $5.8 billion in Q3, and while that was a modest 4.2% year-over-year increase, it reverses the overall revenue decline the company suffered in the first half of 2023. Plus, AMD's forecast for the current fourth quarter points to $6.1 billion in revenue, which would translate into an accelerated 9% growth rate.Investors are looking ahead to a rosy 2024, which should be dominated by strong sales of AI chips. Therefore, despite the 16.4% jump in AMD stock last week, it still looks highly attractive based on the company's growth potential next year and beyond.John Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool\u2019s board of directors.

Learn MoreThere's no letup in the hotly contested field of computing. Intel (INTC 5.91%) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 1.74%) are the two largest producers of x86 CPUs and GPUs in the world. Intel controls 61.5% of the x86 CPU market, according to PassMark Software, while AMD holds a 35.6% share.As for GPUs, Intel accounts for 68%, according to Jon Peddle Research, while AMD and Nvidia control 14% and 18%, respectively. However, Intel's share primarily consists of lower-end integrated GPUs, while AMD and Nvidia share a near-duopoly in stand-alone, discrete GPUs for high-end graphics and gaming.Image source: Getty Images.Intel and AMD are often considered archrivals, but their business models are different. Intel is an integrated device manufacturer (IDM) which designs and manufactures most of its own chips. AMD is a fabless chipmaker which outsources the production of its chips to third-party foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. AMD's partnership with TSMC, which pulled ahead of Intel in the \"process race\" to manufacture smaller chips in recent years, enables it to produce denser chips than Intel.Over the past five years, AMD's stock rallied more than 450% as Intel's stock slumped nearly 20%. The bulls rushed to AMD as it gained ground against Intel in the PC race, while the bears pounced on Intel as it lagged behind TSMC and struggled with persistent chip shortages and delays. But is AMD still a better buy than Intel?Intel and AMD both suffered slowdowns over the past year as the PC market cooled off in a post-pandemic market. However, Intel's revenue has declined year over year for seven consecutive quarters, while AMD only suffered two consecutive quarters of revenue declines before returning to growth in the third quarter of 2023.MetricQ3 2022Q4 2022Q1 2023Q2 2023Q3 2023Intel Revenue Growth (YOY)(15%)(28%)(36%)(15%)(8%)AMD Revenue Growth (YOY)29%16%(9%)(18%)4%Data source: Intel and AMD. YOY = Year-over-year.Intel's slowdown was caused by the simultaneous declines of its client-computing group, which produces its PC chips; its data center and AI group, which sells its Xeon server chips and programmable chips; and its network and edge group, which produces networking products and edge-computing chips.As Intel struggled against AMD in the cooling PC market, the macroheadwinds throttled the growth of its data center and networking businesses. But on the bright side, its revenue actually grew sequentially over the past two quarters, and it expects its revenue to finally grow year over year in the fourth quarter of the year as the PC market stabilizes.AMD suffered a milder slowdown because it stayed ahead of Intel in the laptop and hybrid markets with denser and more power-efficient CPUs, while its Radeon GPUs benefited from the stabilization of the PC gaming market.The growth of AMD's Ryzen CPUs and Radeon GPUs offset its weaker sales of custom system-on-chips (SoCs) for gaming consoles and programmable chips for data centers. It expects its year-over-year revenue growth to accelerate in Q4 as it ramps up its shipments of high-end Instinct GPUs for AI-oriented data centers.Intel's CPUs still generally cost more than AMD's CPUs, yet AMD's fabless business model enables it to produce cheaper chips at higher gross margins. Intel has been outsourcing some of the production of its non-core chips (most notably its GPUs) to TSMC, but it still manufactures most of its chips at its first-party foundries.MetricQ3 2022Q4 2022Q1 2023Q2 2023Q3 2023Intel Adj. Gross Margin46%44%38%40%46%AMD Adj. Gross Margin50%51%50%50%51%Data source: Intel and AMD.Meanwhile, Intel has been ramping up its investments in its first-party foundries in a bid to catch up to TSMC in the process race by 2025. That spending causes Intel to generate lower operating margins than AMD, although its cost-cutting measures significantly boosted its operating margin in its latest quarter.MetricQ3 2022Q4 2022Q1 2023Q2 2023Q3 2023Intel Adj. Operating Margin11%4%(3%)4%14%AMD Adj. Operating Margin23%23%21%20%22%Data source: Intel and AMD.Analysts expect Intel's revenue and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to decline 22% and 68%, respectively, this year. But next year, they expect its revenue and adjusted EPS to grow 12% and 176% as the PC market stabilizes; it ramps up its shipments of its new Meteor Lake chips; and the macro environment improves.Analysts expect AMD's revenue and adjusted EPS to dip 9% and 26%, respectively, this year. But for 2024, they expect its revenue and adjusted EPS to grow 21% and 51%, respectively, as the PC market warms up and it ships more Instinct GPUs.Based on those estimates, Intel trades at 21 times forward earnings, while AMD has a higher forward multiple of 30. Both of these stocks are still great long-term plays on the semiconductor market. But if I had to pick one over the other, I'd stick with AMD because it's growing faster; its margins are healthier; and it still seems to have a brighter future than Intel.Leo Sun has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Learn MoreAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD 1.74%) is finally out of the rut it was in thanks to a weak personal computer (PC) market, and that's because of the improving conditions in the PC space and the company's growing prominence in the market for artificial intelligence (AI) chips.AMD released its third-quarter results on Oct. 31, and the good news is that the chipmaker has finally returned to year-over-year growth following a poor performance in the first half of 2023. Let's look closely at AMD's latest quarterly performance and check why this semiconductor stock could rise once again after pulling back nearly 13% from the 52-week high it hit in mid-June.AMD reported Q3 revenue of $5.8 billion, an increase of 4% over the year-ago quarter. The number exceeded the midpoint of the company's guidance of $5.7 billion, which is also what analysts were anticipating it to deliver in Q3. AMD's adjusted earnings also increased 4% year over year to $0.70 per share, ahead of the Wall Street estimate of $0.68 per share.The biggest reason behind the improvement in AMD's financial performance last quarter was its client processor segment, which houses sales of central processing units (CPUs) used in laptops and desktops. The segment's revenue increased 42% year over year to $1.5 billion, driven primarily by a jump in sales of the company's laptop processors.Management pointed out on the latest earnings conference call that sales of its Ryzen processors increased \"significantly in the quarter as inventory levels in the PC market normalized and demand began returning to seasonal patterns.\" The good part is that AMD could continue to witness a turnaround in the client processor business as PC sales recover.According to IDC, PC shipments were down 7.6% year over year in the third quarter of 2023. That was much slower than the year-over-year declines of 13.4% seen in the second quarter and 29% in the first quarter. Given that the market is expected to return to growth next year, AMD should be able to sustain its momentum and deliver stronger results.A notable takeaway from AMD's latest earnings call was the anticipated ramp-up in sales of its upcoming MI300 data center accelerators that are targeted toward AI workloads. CEO Lisa Su claimed that \"multiple large hyperscale customers committed to deploy Instinct MI300 accelerators.\" The company has already started shipping MI300A chips, and it will start shipping the flagship MI300X AI accelerators to cloud customers in \"the coming weeks.\"More importantly, Su has quantified the impact of its MI300 family of AI accelerators on the company's business. \"Based on the rapid progress we are making with our AI road map execution and purchase commitments from cloud customers, we now expect Data Center GPU revenue to be approximately $400 million in the fourth quarter and exceed $2 billion in 2024 as revenue ramps throughout the year,\" she said on the earnings call.AMD was earlier anticipating the MI300 processors to clock $300 million in revenue in the fourth quarter. The upgraded estimate suggests that its AI chips are finding favor among customers. Also, AMD's revenue forecast from AI chips for 2024 indicates that it expects to clock a quarterly revenue run rate of $500 million. However, don't be surprised to see AMD's AI revenue ramping up at a faster pace for a couple of simple reasons.First, AI chip demand is expected to grow at a faster pace of 26% in 2024 to $67 billion following this year's forecast increase of 21% to $53 billion, according to Gartner.Second, AMD's rival Nvidia is flooded with orders for its AI processors, and customers are reportedly having to wait for as long as six months to get their hands on its chips. AMD can take advantage of this opportunity and make its mark in the market for AI chips, especially considering that it is reportedly going to corner a nice chunk of supply from its foundry partner.AMD has guided for $6.1 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter, which would be a 9% jump over the prior-year period's figure of $5.6 billion. While that points toward an acceleration from the year-over-year growth AMD delivered in Q3, analysts were expecting a stronger revenue jump to $6.4 billion. Investors, however, should focus on the bigger picture.Management has already raised its forecast for revenue from AI chips for Q4, so there is a chance that its actual performance may turn out to be better if demand strengthens. Also, AMD's top-line growth is set to take off from 2024 following this year's anticipated drop of 9%.AMD Revenue Estimates for Next Fiscal Year data by YChartsAssuming AMD does hit $31 billion in revenue in 2025, as the chart above indicates, and maintains its five-year average price-to-sales ratio of 7.6 at that time, its market capitalization could jump to $235 billion. That would translate into 30% gains from current levels. However, don't be surprised to see AMD delivering a stronger upside thanks to the massive opportunity in AI chips, because of which the market could reward it with a higher sales multiple.After all, Nvidia trades at an expensive 31 times sales, and AMD may be able to command such a multiple if AI leads to outsize growth in the company's top and bottom lines. All this explains why AMD jumped 4% after its latest earnings report as investors looked past the near-term guidance, and it won't be a bad idea to buy more of this AI stock before it flies higher.Harsh Chauhan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Learn MoreInvestors will likely remember 2023 as the year artificial intelligence (AI) hit its stride. After a brutal sell-off in 2022, AI served as a catalyst that brought many investors back into tech stocks.Now, in November, some of these stocks have resumed the momentum from earlier in the year. Because of those increases, AI stocks like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 1.74%), CrowdStrike (CRWD 0.02%), and Palantir (PLTR -1.10%) could serve investors well now and into 2024.Admittedly, AMD may seem like a strange choice, given the dominance of Nvidia in the AI chip space. Due to Nvidia's market lead, the recent release and the upcoming ramp of AMD's MI300 chip may seem like a move that is too little, too late in terms of competing.However, AMD has a history of catching up and sometimes surpassing rivals, and the MI300 chip has shown signs of early success. CEO Lisa Su said on the Q3 2023 earnings call it could bring about the fastest ramp to $1 billion in sales for a specific AMD product in company history.Indeed, AMD's financials seem to reinforce this sentiment. After recent declines, revenue in the third quarter of 2023 was $5.8 billion, rising 4% from year-ago levels.Moreover, operating income turned positive. That led to Q3 net income of $299 million, a 353% increase from the $66 million in the same quarter last year.That subsequent recovery may have helped the stock surge higher by 75% in 2023. Also, investors can buy shares at a comparative bargain, since Nvidia's massive 33 price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is well above the sales multiple of 8 for AMD. As the adoption of MI300 chips continues to grow, AMD stock should continue to rise along with the company's AI capabilities.One area that has made extensive use of AI is cybersecurity, and CrowdStrike is in an excellent position to capitalize on the technology. Investors know the company best for endpoint security and leveraging crowdsourced data to identify potential attackers. But CrowdStrike also describes its Falcon security suite as an \"AI-native\" platform, delivering what it calls \"the world's most advanced protection\" from today's threats.To that end, the company introduced Charlotte AI in May, a generative AI solution that uses what it deems \"high-fidelity\" security data. The software continuously improves the system using CrowdStrike's experts, threat hunters, and its operators pertaining to managed detection and response.And despite some slowing in cloud spending, CrowdStrike managed to grow its quarterly revenue to $732 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended July 31), a 37% yearly increase.Over time, the company has pared operating losses, so much so that it managed an $8.5 million net income in fiscal Q2. About $37 million in interest income compensated for the $15 million operating loss, allowing CrowdStrike to turn profitable.Thanks to such improvements, the stock is up over 82% this year. And since its 17 P/S ratio is coming off record lows, investors can still buy while the stock is comparatively inexpensive.Another company making massive technical gains with AI is Palantir. The use of the technology is nothing new to the big data company, as AI and machine learning deliver insights through an end-to-end deployment infrastructure combined with enterprise data foundations.Building on that foundation, Palantir recently released a platform based on generative AI called AIP, which has allowed the company to make considerable strides in helping customers.On its Q3 2023 earnings call, Palantir cited clients using AIP that achieved more in a day than they would have in months without the technology. And despite its release in Q2, over 140 organizations will have completed its AIP boot camp by the end of November, so adoption has occurred quickly.It is unclear how AIP affected financials, but revenue in Q3 of $558 million grew 17% versus the same quarter last year. Also, Palantir turned an operating profit, allowing it to earn $73 million in net income, up from a loss of $124 million in the year-ago quarter. With those earnings, it managed its fourth consecutive quarter of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profit amid improving financials.Additionally, with the anticipation surrounding AIP, Palantir stock has risen over 195% this year. Consequently, its P/S ratio has risen to an elevated level of 19. Nonetheless, with the productivity gains achieved by AIP's clients, Palantir has likely positioned itself to command such premium valuations.Will Healy has positions in Advanced Micro Devices and Palantir Technologies.

Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn MoreIf there's one constant on Wall Street, it's that there'll always be a next-big-thing trend captivating investors' attention. Since the advent of the internet roughly 30 years ago, we've watched as a myriad of innovations and trends have fueled optimism on Wall Street, including genomics, business-to-business commerce, 3D printing, cannabis, electric vehicles, and blockchain technology, to name a few. Right now, absolutely nothing is hotter than artificial intelligence (AI).AI involves the use of software and systems to handle tasks typically assigned to humans. The key ingredient for AI is the inclusion of machine learning, which allows software and systems to become smarter over time, and thusly more efficient or expansive at their tasks.Image source: Getty Images.According to a report released earlier this year by PwC, AI could add $15.7 trillion to worldwide gross domestic product by 2030, with $6.6 trillion coming from increased productivity and $9.1 trillion derived from a boost in consumption.Even if PwC's forecast proves lofty, it's crystal clear that there's a lot of money being thrown at AI innovations by many of today's largest companies. However, it doesn't mean every AI stock is necessarily going to be a winner.As we steam ahead into November, one artificial intelligence stock stands out as a genius buy, while another widely owned AI stock is priced for perfection and best avoided by investors.Among the dozens of large-scale companies incorporating AI into their future growth prospects, it's social media stock Meta Platforms (META 0.06%) that rises head and shoulders above the pack in November.Meta is utilizing AI in a variety of ways on its world-leading social media platforms. For instance, it's leaning on AI solutions to filter through a veritable sea of comments on its sites to weed out those that don't meet community standards.Perhaps an even more exciting real-world use of AI is the generative AI tools Meta began rolling out to all of its advertisers a little over one month ago. Generative AI will help advertisers tailor and customize their ads for individual users, with the end goal to improve engagement and follow-through sales.Looking to the future, Meta aims to be a major player in the \"metaverse\" -- the collective term used to describe the virtual 3D environment where people will be able to interact with each other and their surroundings. CEO Mark Zuckerberg is overseeing a sizable ramp up in spending for his company's Reality Labs segment, which has developed virtual reality headsets and smart glasses for consumers.Aside from its AI ambitions, Meta Platforms is a cash cow. The company owns four of the most-downloaded social sites on the planet: Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook Messenger. Though Threads doesn't make the list, it became the fastest app to reach 100 million users (five days) when it was launched in early July.Meta attracted nearly 4 billion monthly active users during the September-ended quarter, which means advertisers aren't going to find easier access to more eyeballs on any other social platform. Having the most-valuable social media \"real estate\" affords Meta exceptional ad-pricing power.Additionally, Meta Platforms is swimming with cash. It closed out September with more than $61 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Even with losses growing from its Reality Labs segment and AI investments, this cash, coupled with the $51.7 billion the company has generated in net cash from operations through the first nine months of 2023, affords Meta the ability to take risks.The last reason Meta is such a genius buy in November is its valuation. Despite more than tripling from its 2022 bear market low, shares of the company can be purchased for roughly 10 times consensus cash flow for 2024. That's markedly below the multiple of nearly 16 times cash flow Meta has traded at over the previous five years.Image source: Getty Images.However, there are two sides to every coin. Although AI has been the hottest thing since sliced bread in 2023, and no stock has benefited from this next-big-thing investment more than graphics processing unit (GPU) provider Nvidia (NVDA 0.38%), it's Wall Street's hottest megacap that deserves the cold shoulder in November.Nvidia's claim to fame is its A100 and H100 GPUs. These are AI-driven GPUs used in high-compute enterprise data centers. AI software and systems require split-second decision-making, and Nvidia's GPUs are, currently, the foundation of AI's evolution.The interesting thing about Nvidia's expected doubling in sales this year is that it's been fueled almost entirely by the company's pricing power. Through the first six months of Nvidia's fiscal 2024 (Nvidia's fiscal 2024 began on Jan. 30, 2023), the company's cost of revenue has actually declined from the comparable period in the previous year. With chip-fab giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing having maxed out its chip on wafer on substrate capacity, Nvidia has been unable to increase supply of its A100 and H100 GPUs.The irony for Nvidia, and one of the reasons it's an AI stock to avoid in November, is that an expected increase in GPUs for AI-accelerated data centers in the upcoming year is likely going to be detrimental to its gross margin. Though it'll be selling more units, its A100 and H100 GPUs will no longer be scarce. As a result, the company's pricing power will almost certainly decline.To add to the above, competition is beginning to pick up in the AI-GPU arena. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 1.74%) debuted its MI300X GPU in June, which it anticipates will be a direct rival to Nvidia's lineup of AI-accelerated GPUs. Though AMD plans to roll out the MI300X to a handful of customers this year, it'll be demonstrably ramping up production in 2024. Likewise, Intel expects to bring its AI-driven Falcon Shores GPU to market by mid-decade. Long story short, more choices for businesses means potentially less pricing power for Nvidia.Another concern for the hottest megacap in 2023 is that U.S. regulators have been limiting exports of high-powered AI chips to China. The global No. 2 economy orders billions of dollars' worth of chips from Nvidia. With these new restrictions in place, Nvidia could see its sales potential meaningfully crimped.Nvidia's valuation also looks impossible to sustain, especially with AI-GPU competition picking up. Investors today would be paying nearly 46 times consensus cash flow in the current fiscal year.The tea leaves suggest Nvidia could struggle mightily moving forward.Randi Zuckerberg, a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Learn MoreAnalysts at Bloomberg expect generative artificial intelligence (AI) to become a $1.3 trillion industry as companies develop complex AI-based applications and the training infrastructure to support them. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 1.74%) and Super Micro Computer (SMCI -1.77%) focus on the latter side of the market and could enjoy impressive growth as the opportunity expands. Let's discuss why they could make good alternatives to the current market leader, Nvidia. With shares up by a whopping 68% year to date, AMD stock has risen substantially in anticipation of an AI-driven boost in its revenue and earnings potential. While the company seems to have a slower product launch cycle than its biggest rival Nvidia, new AI chips could become an increasingly important part of its operations.So far, Nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of the generative AI trend, with sales of data center chips like the A100 and H100 already boosting revenue. AMD has been much later to the party. In the fiscal third quarter, its data center revenue was flat at $1.6 billion despite launching its new MI300A and MI300X graphics processing units (GPUs) designed to serve AI and cloud computing workloads. That said, AMD's management is hugely optimistic about the potential of this new hardware. According to CEO Lisa Su, \"multiple, large hyperscale customers\" have committed to buying M1300 chips. And AMD expects the products to add a whopping $2 billion to its top line in 2024. Over the long term, investors can also expect a recovery in AMD's other businesses, like gaming hardware, when challenges like high interest rates (which hurt consumer purchasing power) ease -- although it is unclear when that will happen. For investors, AMD's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 26 looks quite reasonable, considering its exposure to a fast-growing and potentially high-impact industry like generative AI. For context, the S&P 500 has an average P/E of 24. With its share price rocketing by 192% year to date, Super Micro Computer's 2023 performance has somewhat mirrored Nvidia's, which is up by a slightly higher 204% in the same period. Supermicro's bull run can continue because of its deep industry partnerships and relatively low stock valuation compared to other AI-related alternatives. Image source: Getty Images.Unlike AMD or Nvidia, which tackle the AI opportunity by providing specialized GPUs, Supermicro sells pre-built servers designed to facilitate the use of these chips for AI and other data center workloads. While it plays in a competitive industry, it stands out because of its partnership with Nvidia (it builds its servers based on Nvidia hardware) and its focus on energy-efficient designs, which are important for training demanding AI platforms in a cost-efficient manner. Supermicro's management expects sales of $10 billion to $11 billion in fiscal 2024, which is a 47% jump from the $7.12 billion generated in the prior-year period. And with a price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of 1.98 compared to the S&P 500 average of 2.37, the stock is a relatively cheap way to bet on the AI opportunity.As with previous technology bombshells like the internet in the early 2000s, artificial intelligence has generated a lot of hype that might not always translate into sustainable shareholder value. That said, infrastructure-focused companies are generally a safer bet because they have a \"picks-and-shovels\" approach, which leads to stronger moats and less competition than consumer-focused alternatives. AMD and Supermicro could make excellent alternatives to Nvidia because of their reasonable valuations and compelling long-term growth drivers.

Learn MoreThe development of popular artificial intelligence (AI) applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT wouldn't be possible without advanced semiconductors (chips). They are fitted inside data centers managed by cloud providers like Amazon, which are rented by AI developers to train their models.Semiconductor giant Nvidia has an estimated 90% market share in the emerging industry for AI data center chips, but Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 1.74%) recently launched its own line of competing hardware.AMD has struggled over the last 12 months because its core business involves selling chips for segments like gaming and personal computing -- precisely where consumers have cut spending amid challenging economic conditions. As a result, AMD stock trades 30% below its all-time high.But the company just reported its financial results for the third quarter, and investors have plenty to look forward to, including billions of dollars in potential sales of its new AI chips in 2024. Here's why now is a great time for investors to buy the dip.Image source: Getty Images.AMD is one of the most renowned semiconductor companies in the world. Its chips can be found in a long list of leading consumer electronics, including high-end computers, top gaming consoles like Sony's PlayStation 5 and Microsoft's Xbox, and even the infotainment systems in Tesla's electric vehicles.But there's a greater opportunity on the horizon for AMD. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says $1 trillion worth of existing data center infrastructure needs upgrading to support accelerated computing and AI, and while his company currently has almost the entire market to itself, AMD is focused on snatching some market share.Earlier this year, AMD revealed its new MI300 lineup of data center chips designed for AI workloads. The company says its MI300A variant combines computing processors (CPUs) with graphics processors (GPUs) to create the world's first accelerated processing unit (APU) for data centers. AMD began shipping the MI300A to the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory last month to power the El Capitan supercomputer, which will be the most powerful on the planet when it comes online next year. AMD says its data center GPU chips alone could exceed $2 billion in revenue in 2024, which would make the MI300 the fastest product to ramp to $1 billion in sales in the company's history.But AMD is also tackling a new frontier, which is AI-enabled personal computers and devices. Its Ryzen AI lineup of chips is now available in 50 notebook designs with more coming thanks to collaborations with Microsoft, which already has a history of using AMD hardware in its Surface devices. Ryzen AI will allow computers to run AI workloads on-device, which can make them far more responsive than relying on cloud-based applications hosted by external data centers.Through the first six months of 2023, AMD's revenue sank by 13.8% on a year-over-year basis. It was led by a whopping 59% drop in its client segment, which includes the chips the company makes for third-party computers and devices. But in the third quarter, AMD's revenue grew by a modest 4.2% year over year, to $5.8 billion -- but this time, it was actually led higher by the client segment, which saw a 42% revenue increase on its own. The result was driven by strong demand for the Ryzen 7000 series chips, which includes the AI variants I mentioned earlier.Data center revenue remained flat, but with large-scale MI300 shipments on the horizon, that is very likely to change soon.AMD anticipates $6.1 billion in total revenue in the current fourth quarter of 2023, which would mark an accelerated year-over-year growth rate of 9%. It's a great sign AMD's business is now on the upswing after a challenging 12-month period.AMD's profitability has suffered lately. With revenue falling, AMD had to carefully manage its costs while still investing in the development of its new AI chips, which created a headwind at its bottom line. It resulted in the company's non-GAAP earnings per share sinking by 45% in the first half of 2023. But the company's non-GAAP earnings returned to growth in Q3, increasing by 4% compared to the same quarter last year. Its trailing-12-month earnings per share now stands at $2.57, and based on a current stock price of $108.79, AMD is trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 42 at the moment. That's significantly more expensive than the 29 P/E ratio of the Nasdaq-100 index, which is a good benchmark for the average valuation of large technology companies. While that sounds unattractive, investors are faced with a very different picture when they look ahead to 2024. Wall Street analysts predict the company's earnings will come in at $3.93 for the year, which places AMD stock at a far more palatable forward P/E ratio of 27.7. There might even be upside to that earnings number if the uptake of AMD's AI chips occurs at a faster rate than analysts predict, or even if interest rates fall and the economy improves faster than expected.Therefore, AMD stock looks like a bargain right here at a 30% discount to its all-time high, especially for investors who can hold on for the next few years while AMD ramps up its AI sales.John Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

            "title": "Here's what is really driving tech stocks \u2014 and it's not AI, says Deutsche Bank",
            "description": "Analysis of some company transcripts finds a negative correlation between the intensity of AI chatter and share price performance.The stock market is looking chipper again as bond yields slide on hopes the Federal Reserve is done raising interest rates. A well-received earnings report from Apple after Thursday\u2019s closing bell could reinforce the latest rally in big tech stocks.Still, some investors and market observers are concerned that much of the gains in the tech sector this year have been caused by over-exuberance regarding AI. The inference is that such stocks may be vulnerable to a waning of the AI narrative.Fear not, because according to Galina Pozdnyakova and Luke Templeman, analysts at Deutsche Bank, AI\u2019s impact on the 2023 tech rally has been overstated.They accept that since the launch of ChatGPT a year ago, AI chip maker Nvidia NVDA, +0.41%, for example, has seen its shares surge about 140%, and the Nasdaq-100 NDX has gained around 20%. Yet they argue that other factors suggest that AI optimism has not been the main driver of tech markets.\u201cIt is true that tech has somewhat decoupled from the broader market this year, but it is less clear that AI had a major role in this,\u201d they say, and provide the chart below that shows a measure of abnormal returns for the tech sector compared with the rest of the market.\u201cThere is a visible outperformance wave in the first months of the year when tech benefited from a risk-on mood as well as in the aftermath of large drawdowns in 2022,\u201d they say. \u201cLater on, big tech rallied on the back of perceived haven status amid the SVB selloff, followed by another advance around an upbeat forecast from Nvidia in late May.\u201dSo, what are the other non-AI factors that have driven tech stocks? Rising real yields has been an important narrative since the summer, with moves within the sector becoming more synchronized.\u201cWhile, early on, ChatGPT propelled semiconductor stocks and left the software industry firms behind, now, various industries across the TMT sector seem to be converging. That points to a waning effect on markets of generative AI and indicates investors are refocusing on non-AI factors in their stock decisions,\u201d say the Deutsche Bank analysts.Another way to observe AI\u2019s waning influence on the market is to split out semiconductor stocks from software and services firms. The chart below shows an initial jump in semiconductor stocks \u2014 mainly driven by Nvidia \u2013after ChatGPT\u2019s launch in November last year.This was followed by some smaller market oscillations related to earnings of semiconductor companies, alongside the a selloff in those software stocks considered vulnerable to the use of ChatGPT.\u201cNevertheless, the wedge between the two industry groups has stabilized over the last few months, showing few new AI-driven shocks. Moreover, semiconductor stocks came under pressure as investors tempered expectations,\u201d say Pozdnyakova and Templeman.The Deutsche Bank analysts also looked at corporate transcripts and found there was much AI talk, but little positive share price action. The mentions of AI-related words in company documents have sharply accelerated this year as management try to pitch revenue and/or cost benefits from the technology, they note.However, stock returns have a negative correlation to the intensity of AI chatter. Taking a sample of 77 Russell 300 stocks, the analysts found that the correlation between total returns since the first quarter and the intensity of AI talk in fourth quarter 2023 to first quarter 2023 transcripts was minus 29%.\u201cIn part, this is because AI was more in focus for smaller and less profitable firms. In other words, corporate AI enthusiasm is sticky, unlike investor attitudes which seem to be more discerning,\u201d they say.Pozdnyakova and Templeman reckon that big gains in AI, in the near term, will likely come from within the private markets as venture capital picks the next winners.\u201cIndeed, beyond a handful of stocks, there have been few clear winners or losers from the buzz around generative AI. At present, some of the major non-semiconductor players are still figuring out the product,\u201d they conclude.U.S. stock-index futures ES00, -0.17% YM00, -0.40% NQ00, -0.18% are higher as benchmark Treasury yields BX:TMUBMUSD10Y slide.

            "title": "Apple's new Mac laptops aren't good enough to keep buyers from switching to PCs",
            "description": "Apple leaves the door wide open for AMD, Qualcomm, Intel and others to offer better and faster technology.During its \u201cScary Fast\u201d announcement event on Monday night, Apple AAPL, +0.66% took to the internet to announce a string of new MacBook Pro laptops and a new family of chips to power them. The event itself happened at 8 p.m. Eastern Time, during both the World Series and Monday Night Football \u2014 odd timing for a company that is targeting mass consumer audiences for its messages. At the heart of all the new MacBook Pro laptops is a series of M3 processors, for the first time announced and available in the same window. It\u2019s been less than a year since Apple launched the M2 Pro and M2 Max CPUs, and just four months since the M2 Max was released. This is an extremely rapid rollout for an entire new family of processors and probably indicates that sales of that earlier generation weren\u2019t living up to expectations. Here are the details: The M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max follow in the steps of the M2 and M1 processors, with custom designs completely created in-house, manufactured on the latest TSMC 3nm process node. The base model M3 is made of 25 billion transistors, features up to an 8-core CPU and a 10-core GPU. The M3 Pro goes up to 12-cores on the CPU and 18-cores on the GPU (37 billion transistors), while the M3 Max CPU core count reaches up to 16 with a 40-core GPU (92 billion transistors). There are other differences between the chips including maximum system memory capacity, how many external displays are supported (still only 1 on the base M3). All of them share the same 16-core NPU (neural processing unit) for AI computing.Performance claims from Apple are as vague as they have ever been, with little to no documentation on how performance is measured, so it\u2019s always wise to take the results with a grain of salt. That said, the new performance cores on the M3 family are 15% faster than the M2 from last year, while the efficiency cores are 30% faster than the M2. (Remember that Apple uses a combination of high-performance and high-efficiency cores to build their phone and laptop chips.) The performance of the graphics of the M3 products are roughly 50% faster than the M1 (no claim vs the M2 was made). The specs and claims around the new M3 family are solid, as you would expect from Apple. But there are areas where these products walk backwards. The M3 Pro, as an example, actually decreases the number of performance CPU cores by 25% (from eight to six) but increases the number the smaller efficiency cores by two. The GPU core count decreases by one, though we assume overall performance is still much higher because of the graphics architecture Apple introduced that supports hardware accelerated ray tracing functions. \u201cNo word on how AI is being utilized in the Mac application ecosystem. \u201d This leaves me with questions about what is going to drive buyers to this new family of MacBook Pro products. The physical designs themselves are the same as the previous models with the lone exception of a cool-looking Space Black colorway. Apple didn\u2019t spend much time during its short 30-minute announcement showing or talking about new use cases or consumer experiences that are enabled by the M3 chips; something in itself an interesting shift for a company that typically hammers the competition on what it can do that others simply cannot. The opening to the event did showcase a lot of Mac users \u201cdoing work\u201d but there was no discussion about anything new or drastically improved. And throughout the announcement we saw a number of quick jump cuts between applications, but no focus or emphasis. There also was no real emphasis on the AI capabilities of these devices, despite being the first major silicon provider to integrate an NPU in their laptop designs with the M1. Apple claims that the new 16-core NPU design offers 18 TOPS of performance, a modest increase from the 15.8 TOPS from the M2. But mentions of how AI is being utilized in the Mac application ecosystem, or how generative AI is coming to this platform, were missing. For as big of an increase as the company claims the new GPU architecture is over previous designs, including support for critical new features including mesh shading and ray tracing, and a new memory management tech it calls Dynamic Caching, any mention of gaming was passing at best. At one point Apple referenced the M3 as being able to play a remake of Myst released in 2021 that has minimum requirements that include GPUs that came out in 2016! Apple continues to build massive, powerful GPUs into their chips but seems happy to continue leaving PC gaming (with nearly 900 million players) to the Windows ecosystem. It\u2019s for these reasons that I believe the door is still wide open for competition from the PC space to gain back some of the Apple Mac market share and mindshare. New chips from Qualcomm QCOM, -0.25%, AMD AMD, +1.59%, and Intel INTC, +5.93% are coming. Qualcomm\u2019s recent Snapdragon X Elite announcement, for example, was all about AI, huge CPU performance claims, and bringing Apple-like battery life to Windows in 2024. Both AMD and Intel have more coming this year about their visions for the \u201cAI PC\u201d race. These competitors are not simply talking about \u201cthe same but better.\u201d They\u2019re focused on areas of the future such as AI acceleration and use cases, drastically improved mobile gaming capabilities, and in some cases massive efficiency improvements.

Learn MoreAMD (AMD 1.74%) posted its third-quarter report on Oct. 31. The chipmaker's revenue rose 4% year over year to $5.8 billion and exceeded analysts' expectations by $110 million. Its adjusted earnings also grew 4% to $0.70 per share and cleared the consensus forecast by $0.02.That marked the first time AMD's revenue and adjusted earning per share (EPS) grew in tandem since the second quarter of 2022. Does that earnings beat imply its cyclical slowdown is finally over, and it's the right time to buy its stock?Image source: Getty Images.During the third quarter, AMD generated 28% of its revenue from its data center segment, which sells its Epyc CPUs, Instinct server GPUs, and adaptive system on chips (SoCs) for servers. Its revenue came in flat year over year as its sluggish sales of adaptive SoCs offset its stronger sales of CPUs and GPUs.The client segment, which sells its Ryzen CPUs, grew 42% year over year and accounted for 26% of its top line. Its growth was mainly driven by brisk sales of its mobile Ryzen CPUs for laptops and hybrid devices. The gaming segment, which sells its Radeon GPUs for gaming PCs and semi-custom SoCs for gaming consoles, accounted for another 26% of its top line and posted a year-over-year revenue decline of 8%. Its cyclically slower sales of console SoCs offset its stronger sales of Radeon GPUs for PCs.The remaining 21% of AMD's revenue came from its embedded segment, which was expanded significantly through its acquisition of the programmable chipmaker Xilinx last February. The segment's revenue dipped 5% year over year as the macro headwinds throttled the growth of the communications market.AMD's growth rates indicate its PC market is stabilizing, but its non-PC markets still face some near-term challenges. During the conference call, CEO Lisa Su said, \"inventory levels in the PC market normalized and demand began returning to seasonal patterns,\" but she noted that the cloud market was \"mixed,\" and the enterprise market stayed \"soft.\"MetricQ3 2022Q4 2022Q1 2023Q2 2023Q3 2023Revenue Growth (YOY)29%16%(9%)(18%)4%Adjusted Gross Margin50%51%50%50%51%Adjusted Operating Margin23%23%21%20%22%Adjusted EPS Growth (YOY)(8%)(25%)(47%)(45%)21%Data source: AMD. YOY = Year-over-year.Nevertheless, AMD's strengths clearly offset its weaknesses as its revenue grew year over year for the first time in three quarters. Its adjusted gross margin also expanded sequentially and year over year as its adjusted EPS rose for the first time in five quarters. Its adjusted operating margin dipped year over year, but that was mainly due to higher R&D investments in its AI-oriented Instinct GPUs for data centers.For the fourth quarter, AMD expects its revenue to grow about 9% year over year as its adjusted gross margin expands to approximately 51.5%. That acceleration, which can also be clearly seen in its larger rival Intel's latest earnings report, indicates the PC market has finally reached its cyclical trough.Other tailwinds could also kick in as the broader PC market recovers. AMD expects to ramp up its production of its Instinct GPUs in the fourth quarter to challenge Nvidia in the artificial intelligence (AI) market, and its Epyc CPUs could continue to chip away at Intel's Xeon processors in the data center CPU market.Analysts expect AMD's revenue and adjusted EPS to decline 9% and 26%, respectively, in 2023. But in 2024, they expect its revenue and adjusted EPS to grow 21% and 51%, respectively, as a new growth cycle kicks off. Based on those expectations, AMD's stock still looks reasonably valued at 24 times forward earnings.But Nvidia could still face some unpredictable challenges. Intel's newest Meteor Lake mobile chips could finally reverse its years of market share losses to AMD in the laptop market, while AMD's Radeon GPUs could struggle to keep pace with the newest Nvidia GeForce GPUs. The Biden Administration's latest export curbs on advanced AI chip sales to China could also curb its sales of Instinct GPUs. Lastly, Intel's commitment to catching up to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company in the process race could also enable it to finally produce smaller, denser, and more power-efficient chips than AMD.AMD's stock has already rallied roughly 70% this year in anticipation of the PC market's eventual turnaround; however, it also remains nearly 35% below its all-time high. Its valuations still seem reasonable, it has plenty of irons in the fire, and its core growth engines are warming up again. AMD remains an underdog in CPUs and GPUs, but it's repeatedly proven that it can keep pace with Intel and Nvidia, respectively, in both markets. In short, I believe investors can still buy AMD's stock today to profit from the semiconductor market's cyclical recovery.Leo Sun has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Advanced Micro Devices, Nvidia, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.

Learn MoreShares of processor giant Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 1.74%) surged this week, finishing Thursday trading 11.8% higher than at the beginning of the week, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.AMD has been successful over the past few years with renewed leadership in the CPU space, graphics GPUs and gaming expertise, and the addition of field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) with the acquisition of Xilinx in early 2022.However, its earnings report this week was really all about one thing: the MI300.The MI300 is AMD's new artificial intelligence (AI) accelerator, which investors hope will become a worthy alternative to Nvidia (NVDA 0.38%) GPUs in the AI space.While AMD's guidance actually came in lower than expected, positive commentary on the MI300 was enough to catapult the stock higher through the week.In the third quarter, AMD's revenue grew 4% to $5.8 billion, and non-GAAP (adjusted) EPS also grew 4% to $0.70 per share. Each beat expectations. But the stock initially fell after the report dropped, as AMD's forward revenue guidance of $6.1 billion came up short of the $6.4 billion analysts had been expecting. However, the stock began to rise once CEO Lisa Su began discussing the MI300, and that positivity continued through the rest of the week. On the conference call with analysts, Su noted that AMD had begun shipments of MI300A APUs designed for the El Capitan Exascale Supercomputer. Even more important to AMD's AI prospects, Su also noted large cloud computing customers had committed to deploying the MI300X GPUs and that those shipments would begin soon. There had been some consternation among investors back in June when AMD unveiled the MI300 that AMD didn't announce an \"anchor\" cloud customer. But those fears seem to have abated.Most importantly, Su actually gave revenue projections for the MI300 GPU in the fourth quarter and next year. In Q4, she expects $400 million in MI300 revenue, rising to exceed $2 billion in 2024. \"This growth would make MI300 the fastest product to ramp to $1 billion in sales in AMD history,\" Su noted. Those numbers and commentary came as music to the market's ears.So, why was Q4 guidance a little light? Well, the FPGA market is in a downturn right now. FPGAs have a lot of exposure to industrial customers, and while industrial chips were more resilient than PCs, phones, and data center chips in 2022, industrial-focused chips are now in a correction. However, the PC and data center corrections seem to be bottoming, with those markets now showing signs of turning up.Clearly, the market rightly looked past the cyclical soft patch in FPGAs and focused on AMD's AI chip execution. That's because the AI chip market is forecast to be massive in the years ahead and, therefore, AMD's most important market for the foreseeable future. Su herself predicted earlier this year that the AI GPU market would grow at a 50% average growth rate, reaching $150 billion by 2027.When combined with this week's positive commentary from Fed Chair Jay Powell on inflation, as well as the better-than-expected labor productivity gains in the third quarter, AMD could be set up nicely for 2024. Artificial intelligence revenue plus falling interest rates would be a good combination.Billy Duberstein has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.The Arora Report is known for its accurate calls.

Learn MoreAdvanced Micro Devices' (AMD 1.74%) share price has surged by 54% over the past year, and many investors are wondering if the semiconductor stock has more room to run. Part of its gains have been driven by investors' optimism that chip companies will continue to benefit from increasing demand for new technologies like artificial intelligence (AI). But to figure out whether or not AMD is a buy right now, let's look at what's going right for AMD and what could hold the company back. A large portion of AMD's revenue comes from sales of its CPUs for personal computers. And while AMD has built a large business around this focus, that hasn't been much of a benefit lately. That's because PC shipments worldwide fell by 13% in the second quarter, according to IDC. Image source: GETTY IMAGES.That lack of demand really hurt AMD's results. In Q2 -- its most recently reported quarter -- the company's client segment revenue, which includes PC chip sales, fell 54% due to slowing PC sales. It wasn't all bad news -- total client sales were up 35% sequentially to $998 million -- but that year-over-year decline understandably worried investors.PC demand can fluctuate, so AMD could eventually see some rebound in chip sales for PCs, but it's also facing some other threats. First, Intel has made additional gains recently in the PC chip market that have eroded AMD's market share. In 2021, AMD had 39% of the PC CPU market; now, after losing ground to Intel, it has 35%. Intel could continue causing problems for AMD because it's building a new manufacturing facility that could help it ramp up semiconductor production -- an area where AMD currently has an advantage right now. AMD's client revenue from PC chip sales was up on a sequential basis, indicating that the worst may be over in that segment. It's not out of the woods yet, but the sales growth is certainly a good sign. The company is also making some big moves to try and tap into the vast artificial intelligence chip business. It recently debuted a new line of MI300 data center graphics processing units (GPUs) and acquired an AI software company to help optimize its semiconductors for artificial intelligence uses. The AI chip market is worth $28 billion this year, and Statista estimates it will grow to be a $165 billion market by 2030, giving AMD a lot of potential to benefit. Artificial intelligence has emerged as one of the biggest tech trends -- with large tech companies investing billions of dollars to stake out their places in it -- and it's likely that chip companies will be winners thanks to the massive computing power that AI systems require. Despite some things going well for AMD right now, I think the negatives outweigh the positives right now. For one, PC demand could slow or stagnate again and weigh down AMD's PC chip sales. Additionally, if Intel does gain a manufacturing edge in that niche, it could put additional pressure on AMD. Secondly, while AI chips are a huge market, AMD is far behind rival Nvidia. The latter has been perfecting its GPUs for machine-learning data centers for years, and is now benefiting immensely from its early-mover lead. Nvidia's data center revenue soared 171% in its latest quarter -- in part thanks to AI chip demand -- and reached a staggering $10.7 billion. While AMD may hold onto a significant portion of the PC chip market and is getting its foot in the door in the AI market, it's not doing anything that shows it can outpace its competitors. For that reason, when considering a chip stock right now, it may be best to put your money elsewhere.Chris Neiger has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

            "description": "U.S. stocks moved higher to kick off November trading after the Federal Reserve kept its key policy interest rate unchanged, as expected, and the Treasury Department released details of its debt auction plans.U.S. stocks ended sharply higher Wednesday after the central bank kept its key policy interest rate unchanged, as expected, while it leaves the door open for potential future rate hikes. On Tuesday, all three major indexes posted October declines, with each suffering a third straight monthly loss.Stocks ended higher Wednesday after the Federal Reserve kept its policy interest rate steady at the range of 5.25% to 5.5%, as widely expected. Read: Fed holds interest rates steady, keeps further hikes on the tableIn their policy statement, the Fed said it would take into account a wide array of data \u201cin determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2% over time.\u201dOfficials also said that inflation remains elevated, while job gains \u201chave moderated\u201d but \u201cremained strong.\u201d They added that the U.S. economy \u201cexpanded at a strong pace in the third quarter\u201d. \u201cIn our view the statement came across as balanced,\u201d Ellen Zentner, chief U.S. economist and analysts at Morgan Stanley wrote in a Wednesday note. \u201cOn the one hand the Fed chose not to soften its tightening bias. On the other hand, in listing factors that would likely weigh on the economy it added financial conditions into consideration alongside the previously noted credit conditions,\u201d Zenter said. In Fed chair Jerome Powell\u2019s news conference, when asked central bankers\u2019 views on tighter financial conditions, he said those tighter conditions, including rising long-term Treasury yields, a stronger dollar, and lower equities and other factors, could potentially affect future monetary policy decisions. But the tightening must prove to be \u201cpersistent.\u201dHe also said that the Fed is \u201cnot confident yet\u201d that interest-rate policy is sufficiently high enough to bring down inflation, and rate cuts are just not on the table right now. \u201cMy biggest takeaway was that the Fed is acknowledging tighter financial and credit conditions but they are still seeing fairly strong economic activity,\u201d according to David Merrell, managing member and founder of TBH Advisors. \u201cSo they are hopeful that it\u2019s gonna have more effect based on where rates currently stand, and that\u2019s why you are gonna see them pause for longer, and wait for those accumulative rate hikes to take effect,\u201d Merrell said in a call. \u201cJerome Powell will never admit they are on hold. They are gonna keep that stance that we will possible raise rates,\u201d Merrell said. Meanwhile, the Institute for Supply Management said its closely watched index of manufacturing activity fell deeper into contraction territory in October.The ISM manufacturing reading fell 2.3 points to 46.7 in October, the lowest level since July. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had forecast the index to inch up to 49.2%. Any number below 50% reflects a shrinking activity. Manufacturing has contracted for 12 straight months. Cooler activity is seen taking pressure off the Fed to keep tightening monetary policy.\u201cThe surprise slump in the ISM manufacturing index to 46.7 in October, from 49.0, suggests the recent recovery in factory-sector activity is fading and supports our view that the upturn in economic growth in the third quarter is set to be reversed,\u201d said Andrew Hunter, deputy U.S. chief economist at Capital Economics, in a note.At the same time, however, a closely followed index of labor market tightness offered no sign of cooling. Job openings rose slightly in September to 9.6 million, indicating there\u2019s still plenty of demand for labor.However, businesses in the U.S. created just 113,000 new jobs in October, private sector payroll processor ADP said, in a potential sign of a slackening labor market. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had forecast a 130,000 increase.Earlier, in an eagerly anticipated announcement, the U.S. Treasury Department said it would sell $112 billion in notes and bonds next week, not far out of line with expectations.Many investors have partly blamed the rise in benchmark bond yields in recent weeks BX:TMUBMUSD10Y to 16-year highs on the market\u2019s fear about increased supply of Treasurys.See: U.S. Treasury to auction $112 billion next week in refunding, up $9 billion from last quarter\u2014 Jamie Chisholm contributed.

Learn MoreShares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 1.74%) jumped 6% through 10:30 a.m. ET on Wednesday morning, after reporting a big earnings beat last night.Heading into the third quarter, analysts had forecast the semiconductor stock would earn $0.64 per share on sales of $5.4 billion. In fact, AMD earned $0.70 per share on sales of $5.8 billion -- and guided higher as well. Now, not all the news was good. AMD's claimed $0.70 \"profit\" was actually only a non-GAAP (adjusted) number. When calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), earnings per share were only $0.18. What's more, AMD grew its sales by only a modest 4% year over year, with powerful 42% growth in \"client segment\" sales -- chips for personal computers, but no growth at all in data center chip sales (an important factoid for investors in artificial intelligence). Gaming and embedded segment sales were also both down year over year. That being said, AMD scored a big improvement in gross profit margin. Gross margin on the revenue for the quarter -- 47% -- was fully 5 percentage points higher than what AMD earned in the year-ago quarter, and up 1 percentage point from the second quarter of 2023.Operating expenses grew, but more slowly than revenue (rising only 3%), with the result that AMD was able to flip from a year-ago operating loss to a big operating profit this time around. The company ended up with a 4% operating profit margin, a 5.2% net profit margin, and $0.18 per share in profit.And things continue to look up for AMD. Turning to guidance, management forecast that its sales will range from $5.8 billion to $6.4 billion, with a midpoint estimate of $6.1 billion. That's $100 million more revenue than Wall Street is looking for. It also implies that AMD's sales will grow 9% year over year -- or twice the rate of growth seen in Q3 -- with gross profit margin probably inching a bit higher as well.All that being said, however, I cannot bring myself to recommend buying AMD stock, and for one simple reason: valuation.Valued on its GAAP earnings, AMD stock seems ridiculously overpriced at 765 times trailing profits. Yes, AMD grew its earnings nicely in Q3, but long term, analysts still only forecast a 30% annual growth rate for profits over the next five years. Even giving AMD credit for its superior free cash flow, for example ($1.3 billion), and valuing the stock on that metric, I can't get the valuation on this stock any lower than 120 times, which is still expensive for a 30% grower.Long story short, even after a fantastic quarterly report, I'm afraid AMD stock is still a sell for me.Rich Smith has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

            "title": "This fund manager was right that recession fears were overhyped. Now he's betting on strip malls and these other megatrends.",
            "description": "Our call of the day discusses investing in potentially lucrative megatrends in an interview with Aspen Funds' co-founder and chief financial officer Bob FraserWelcome to the historically decent stock month of November, which follows the longest monthly losing streak (three months) for the three major indexes. It kicks off with a Fed meeting and perhaps more important, the Treasurys breakdown of debt issuance.Our call of the day switches gears to discuss investing in potentially lucrative megatrends in an interview with Aspen Funds\u2019 co-founder and chief financial officer Bob Fraser. The 10-year old firm with $300 million in assets under management, operates like a hedge fund, doing private investments for high net worth individuals.Fraser has been pounding the table since June 2022 about over-hyped recession fears, a call that has thus far proved right, and inflation that would be higher for longer. The first megatrend zeroes in on playing the no-recession megatrend.\u201cThe number one way to play no recession is to get your cash to work,\u201d he said. And he suggests investors look at inflation beaters, via \u201cstocks with the ability to pass price increases on the consumer and with fixed costs,\u201d Fraser told MarketWatch in an interview.\u201cOr even better is real estate because real estate is priced on net operating income and thus goes up with inflation,\u201d he said. Investors could buy a home for Airbnb use, or just buy that house they\u2019ve been holding off on, put money in a real-estate investment trust (REIT), or participate in a private fund like Aspen\u2019s.Onto the next megatrend \u2014 neighborhood strip malls. That focuses on a big demographic shift from cities to suburbs as more people work from home and shop nearby at those strip centers. \u201cIn good locations there are almost no vacancies, rents have been increasing and they haven\u2019t built any new ones in about 15 years,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re full and we\u2019re paying half of the replacement cost which is a recipe for making money over time\u2026Add in some expenses and leverage with a little debt, and investors can get 14-18% total returns with 9-11% of that as cash flow.\u201dHow to invest? Aspen packages strip centers into an LLC, giving investors ownership and tax benefits, but REITs like Kimco Realty KIM, -1.08% or Regency Centers REG, -1.08% to name a few also offer exposure. SITE Centers SITC, -0.45% earlier this week announced plans to spin off all of its strip malls into a publicly traded company. The next megatrend is industrial real estate, which Fraser says ties into the some $1 trillion or more U.S. companies spent last year relocating back home. \u201cIt\u2019s actually cheaper to build in the U.S\u2026if you count robotics, you count shipping costs and tariffs and especially if you count energy, because America has the cheapest energy around. So what\u2019s happening is massive. There\u2019s not enough real estate\u2026so one of the best places you know is large, big box industrial real estate,\u201d he said, adding that Prologis PLD, +0.03% is one listed company that\u2019s doing just that.\u201cThat\u2019s a huge, huge trend and it\u2019s not going to stop for the next 20 years. The world is over globalized and now it\u2019s deglobalizing majorly,\u201d he said.The last two megatrends are energy and the coming bubble in multifamily housing. As for the first, Fraser said they are buying up oil fields due to the false belief out there that \u201cthe world is post fossil fuels,\u201d and with oil underdeveloped for the last seven years. \u201cAnd so we\u2019re about to have an energy crisis and it\u2019s going to unfold over the next three to five years\u2026 The only thing that\u2019s going to slow it is a recession, but even if we do have a recession, we still have this declining supply curve. At some point it\u2019s going to hit it, and we still have a problem,\u201d he said. That will include oil prices above $100 a barrel, he said, and for average investors oil futures and major oil companies would offer exposure. One final megatrend from Fraser is more looming \u2014 the \u201cmultifamily meltdown,\u201d as he cites a stat from real estate analytics firm, Newmark, pointing to nearly $200 billion worth of troubled multifamily loans due in the next three years. \u201cDuring COVID, we saw a huge amount of liquidity flood the market and a lot of syndicators invested into multifamily, and multifamily has been kind of a gold standard for real-estate investors, because \u2018people always need a place to live\u2019 and there\u2019s a well-known housing shortage in America. So what happened is they started bidding up the prices way too much,\u201d he said. Investors ended up overpaying and using variable rate financing and their 3% to 4% loans are starting to mature and they now face 8% to 9% rates. \u201cThey can\u2019t refinance them and what\u2019s worse, the property values have come down, so the banks won\u2019t lend enough money on it,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I would say late 2024 or 2025 is probably a good time probably to buy apartment REITs. For us, we\u2019re doing a distressed debt fund, so we basically will come in with debt or preferred equity and we basically go down the capital stack in these deals where we can get equity-like returns with debt-like risk. So it\u2019s a great opportunity,\u201d he said.You can read more about the Aspen\u2019s big megatrends \u2014 seven in total \u2014 here.Stocks DJIA SPX COMP are modestly higher as trading kicks off ahead of the Fed decision later, with bonds BX:TMUBMUSD10Y BX:TMUBMUSD02Y mixed after the Treasury announced refunding plans.

Lisa Su -- President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you, Mitch, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. We executed well in the third quarter, delivering strong top-line and bottom-line growth, achieving multiple milestones on our AI hardware and software road maps, and significantly accelerating our momentum with customers for our AI solutions. In PCs, there are now more than 50 notebook designs powered by Ryzen AI in market, and we are working closely with Microsoft on the next generation of Windows that will take advantage of our on-chip AI Engine to enable the biggest advances in the Windows user experience in more than 20 years. In the Data Center, multiple large hyperscale customers committed to deploy Instinct MI300 accelerators, supported by our latest ROCm software suite and the growing adoption of an open hardware-agnostic software ecosystem.Looking at the third quarter financial results, revenue grew 4% year over year and 8% sequentially to $5.8 billion, driven by record server CPU revenue and strong Ryzen processor sales. Turning to the segment results. Data Center segment revenue of $1.6 billion was flat year over year and up 21% sequentially as solid demand for both third- and fourth-gen EPYC processor families resulted in record quarterly server processor revenue. We gained server CPU revenue share in the quarter as fourth-gen EPYC CPU revenue grew more than 50% sequentially, crossing over to represent a majority of our server processor revenue and unit shipments.In cloud, while the demand environment remained mixed in the quarter, EPYC CPU revenue grew by a strong double-digit percentage sequentially as hyperscalers expanded deployments of EPYC processors to power their internal workloads and public instances while optimizing their infrastructure spend. Nearly 100 new AMD-powered cloud instances launched in the quarter from Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Oracle, Tencent, and others, including multiple general instances that deliver leadership performance for general purpose, HPC, bare metal, and memory-optimized workloads. In enterprise, while overall demand remains soft, we are seeing strong indications that the significant performance and TCO advantages of Genoa and our expanded go-to-market investments are paying off as enterprise revenue grew by a double-digit percentage sequentially. We closed multiple new wins with leading automotive, aerospace, financial services, pharmaceutical, and technology customers, and the number of enterprise customers actively testing EPYC platforms on-prem increased significantly quarter on quarter.We also expanded our fourth-gen EPYC processor portfolio with the launch of our Siena processors that deliver leadership energy efficiency and performance for intelligent edge and telco applications. Dell, Lenovo, Super Micro, and others launched new platforms that expand our EPYC CPU TAM to address telco, retail, and manufacturing applications. With the launch of Siena, we now offer the industry's most performant and most energy-efficient portfolio of server processors across cloud, enterprise, technical, HPC, and edge computing. I am very pleased with the momentum we have built for our EPYC CPU portfolio.We are building on this momentum with our next-gen Turin server processors based on our new Zen 5 core that delivers significant performance and efficiency gains. Turin is in the labs of our top customers and partners now, and customer feedback has been very strong and we're on track to launch in 2024. Looking at our broader Data Center portfolio, we made significant progress in our Data Center GPU business in the third quarter as the multiyear investments we have made in our hardware and software road maps resulted in significant customer traction for our next-generation Instinct MI300 accelerators and particularly our Instinct MI300X GPU that delivers leadership inferencing and training performance. On the hardware side, bring-up and validation of our MI300A and MI300X accelerators continue progressing to plan with performance now meeting or exceeding our expectations.Production shipments of Instinct MI300A APUs started earlier this month to support the El Capitan Exascale Supercomputer, and we are on track to begin production shipments of Instinct MI300x GPU accelerators to lead cloud and OEM customers in the coming weeks. On the software side, we further expanded our AI software ecosystem and made great progress enhancing the performance and features of our ROCm software in the quarter. In addition to ROCm being fully integrated into the mainline PyTorch and TensorFlow ecosystems, Hugging Face models are now regularly updated and validated to run on Instinct accelerators and other supported AMD AI hardware. AI start-up, Lamini, announced they achieved software parity with CUDA for LLMs running on Instinct MI250 GPUs, enabling enterprise customers to easily deploy production-ready LLMs fine-tuned for their specific data on Instinct MI250 GPUs with minimal code changes.We also strengthened our AI software capabilities with the strategic acquisitions of Mipsology and Nod.ai. Mipsology is a long-standing partner with proven expertise delivering AI software and solutions running on top of our adaptive SoCs for data center, edge, and embedded markets. Nod.ai adds a highly experienced team with a track record of substantial contributions to open-source AI compilers and industry-leading software already used by many of the largest cloud enterprise and AI companies. Nod's compiler-based automation software can significantly accelerate the deployment of highly performant AI models optimized for our Instinct, Ryzen, EPYC, Versal, and Radeon processors.Based on the rapid progress we are making with our AI road map execution and purchase commitments from cloud customers, we now expect Data Center GPU revenue to be approximately $400 million in the fourth quarter and exceed $2 billion in 2024 as revenue ramps throughout the year. This growth would make MI300 the fastest product to ramp to $1 billion in sales in AMD history. I look forward to sharing more details on our progress at our December AI event. Turning to our Client segment.Revenue increased 42% year over year and 46% sequentially to $1.5 billion. Sales of our Ryzen 7000 processors featuring our industry-leading Ryzen AI on-chip accelerator, grew significantly in the quarter as inventory levels in the PC market normalized and demand began returning to seasonal patterns. Revenue for our latest-generation client CPUs powered by our Zen 4 core more than doubled sequentially as we saw strong demand for our Ryzen 7000 Series notebook and desktop processors that deliver both leadership energy efficiency and performance across a wide range of workloads. In commercial, we launched our first Threadripper PRO workstation CPUs based on our Zen 4 Core that deliver unmatched performance for multi-threaded professional design, rendering, and simulation applications.Dell, HPE, and Lenovo announced an expanded set of workstations powered by new Threadripper PRO processors as we focus on growing this margin-accretive portion of our client business. Looking forward, we are executing on a multiyear Ryzen AI road map to deliver leadership compute capabilities built on top of Microsoft's Windows software ecosystem to enable the new generation of AI PCs that will fundamentally redefine the computing experience over the coming years. Now, turning to our Gaming segment. Revenue declined 8% year over year and 5% sequentially to $1.5 billion as lower semi-custom revenue was partially offset by increased sales of Radeon GPUs.Although semi-custom SoC sales declined in line with our projections for this point in the console cycle, overall revenue for this console generation continues tracking significantly higher than the prior generation based on strong demand for Microsoft and Sony consoles. In Gaming Graphics, revenue grew both year over year and sequentially, driven by increased demand in the channel. We expanded our Radeon 7000 series with the launch of new RX 7000 Series enthusiast desktop GPUs that offer leadership price performance for 1440p gamers. Turning to our Embedded segment.As we expected, revenue decreased 5% year over year to $1.2 billion. Sequentially, revenue declined 15% as lead times normalized and customers focused on reducing inventory levels. We expanded our leadership Versal SoC portfolio in the quarter with the launches of our first adaptive SoCs with on-chip HBM memory that deliver significant performance and efficiency for memory-bound data center, network, test, and aerospace applications. We also announced our next-generation space-grade Versal SoC that integrates an enhanced AI Engine and is the industry's only solution that supports unlimited reprogramming during development and after deployment.For the fintech market, we launched our latest Alveo Accelerator card that delivers a 7x improvement in latency compared to our prior generation and has already been deployed by multiple trading firms in their ultra-low latency training platforms. Since closing our acquisition of Xilinx a little over a year and a half ago, our Embedded business has grown significantly, driven by our leadership products. Looking ahead, based on our current visibility, we expect Embedded segment revenue to decline sequentially as customers continue working through elevated inventory levels through the first half of 2024. Over the medium term, we see strong growth opportunities for our Embedded business based on our significant design win traction and our broad and differentiated portfolio of embedded FPGAs, CPUs, GPUs, and adaptive SoCs that can address a larger portion of our customers' compute needs.In summary, I'm pleased with our third quarter financial results, driven by the significant acceleration of Zen 4 server and client processor sales. Looking at the next couple of quarters, we expect strong growth in our Data Center business, driven by both EPYC and Instinct processors. This growth will be partially offset by softening demand in our Embedded business and lower semi-custom revenue, given where we are in the console cycle. As the PC market returns to seasonal patterns, we believe we are well-positioned to gain profitable share in the premium and commercial portions of the market based on the strength of our product offerings.We are focused on accelerating our leadership AI capabilities across our entire product portfolio, executing on our hardware and software road maps, and expanding our enterprise computing footprint. I look forward to sharing more details on our AI progress in a few weeks at our Together We Advance AI event. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jean to provide additional color on our third-quarter results and our outlook for Q4. Jean?Jean Hu -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and TreasurerThank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results for the third quarter and then provide our current outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. We delivered better-than-expected third-quarter results with revenue of $5.8 billion and diluted earnings per share of $0.70. On a year-over-year basis, revenue increased 4% as growth in the Client segment revenue was partially offset by lower Gaming and Embedded segment revenue.Revenue was up 8% sequentially, driven by growth in both the Client and the Data Center segment. Gross margin was 51%, up approximately one percentage point year over year, primarily driven by stronger Client segment revenue and product mix. Operating expenses were $1.7 billion, an increase of 12% year over year, primarily driven by higher R&D investment to support our significant AI growth opportunity. Operating income was $1.3 billion, representing a 22% operating margin.Taxes, interest expense, and other was $141 million. For the third quarter, diluted earnings per share was $0.70 compared to $0.67 in the same period last year. Now, turning to our reportable segment. Starting with the Data Center segment, revenue was $1.6 billion, flat year over year as growth in the EPYC processor sales was offset by a decline in adaptive SoC product sales.Data Center revenue grew 21% sequentially, primarily driven by strong sales of our fourth-generation EPYC processors to both cloud and enterprise customers. Data Center segment operating income was $306 million or 19% of revenue compared to $505 million or 31% a year ago. Lower operating income was primarily due to increased R&D investment to support future AI revenue growth and product mix. Client segment revenue was $1.5 billion, up 42% year over year, primarily driven by higher sales of Ryzen mobile processors.On a sequential basis, revenue grew 46% as PC market conditions continued to improve, and we ramped our Ryzen 7000 series to meet strong demand. Client segment operating income was $140 million or 10% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $26 million a year ago, driven by higher revenue and a disciplined opex management. We are pleased that the Client segment returned to profitability in the third quarter. Gaming segment revenue was $1.5 billion, down 8% year over year, primarily due to a decrease in semi-custom revenue, partially offset by increase in Radeon GPU sales.On a sequential basis, Gaming segment revenue declined 5%, in line with our expectations as we are now in the fourth year of the console cycle. Gaming segment operating income was $208 million or 14% of revenue compared to $142 million or 9% a year ago, primarily driven by higher Radeon GPU revenue. Embedded segment revenue was $1.2 billion, down 5% year over year, primarily due to lower sales to the communication market. On a sequential basis, embedded segment revenue declined 15%, primarily due to inventory correction at customers in several end markets.Embedded segment operating income was $612 million or 49% of revenue compared to $635 million or 49% a year ago. Turning to the balance sheet and the cash flow. During the quarter, we generated $421 million in cash from operations and the free cash flow was $297 million. In the fourth quarter, we expect to pay approximately $550 million in cash taxes, primarily due to previously deferred taxes from California disaster relief efforts made available by the IRS.Inventory decreased sequentially by $122 million to $4.4 billion. At the end of the quarter, cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investment was strong at $5.8 billion. We returned $511 million to shareholders, repurchasing 4.8 million shares and we have $5.8 billion in remaining share repurchase authorization. Now, turning to our fourth quarter 2023 outlook.We expect revenue to be approximately $6.1 billion, plus or minus $300 million, an increase of approximately 9% year over year and 5% sequentially. Year over year, we expect revenue for the Data Center and the Client segments to be up by strong double-digit percentage, the Gaming segment to decline, given where we are in the console cycle, and the Embedded segment to decline due to additional softening of demand in the embedded market. Sequentially, we expect Data Center segment to grow by strong double-digit percentage, Client segment revenue to increase, and the Gaming and Embedded segment to decline by double-digit percentage. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 51.5%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.74 billion, non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 13% and the diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.63 billion shares.In closing, I'm pleased with our execution in the third quarter with year-over-year growth in revenue, gross margin, and earnings per share. In the fourth quarter, we expect to benefit from strong Data Center and Client momentum, driven by MI300 AI accelerated ramp and the strength of our high-performance leadership Zen 4 family of products despite lower sales in the Gaming segment and additional softening of demand in the embedded market. Looking ahead, the investment we are making in AI across our Data Center, Client, Gaming, and the Embedded segment enable us to offer one of the best industry's broadest portfolio, targeting the most compelling opportunities and positioning us to drive long-term profitable growth. With that, I'll turn it back to Mitch for the Q&A session.Mitch Haws -- Head of Investor RelationsThank you, Jean. John, we're happy to poll the audience for questions.OperatorThank you, Mitch. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Thank you.One moment, please, while we poll for questions. And the first question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.Toshiya Hari -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystGreat, thank you so much. Lisa, I had two questions. My first one is on the Data Center GPU business. You talked about '24 revenue potentially exceeding $2 billion.I was hoping you could provide a little bit more color. What percentage of this is AI versus supercomputing or other applications? Within AI, maybe talk about the breadth of your customer lineup. And how should we think about which workloads you're addressing, again, within the context of AI? Is it primarily training or inference or both?Lisa Su -- President and Chief Executive OfficerGreat. Thanks, Toshiya, for the question. So, look, we've made significant progress on the overall MI300 program. I think we're very happy with how the technical milestones look.And then also, we've made significant progress from a customer side. Your question as to how the revenue evolves, so the way to think about it is, in the fourth quarter, we said revenue would be approximately $400 million, and that's mostly HPC with some -- the start of our AI ramp. And then as we go into the first quarter, we actually expect revenue to be approximately similar in that $400 million range. And that will be mostly AI so with a very small piece being HPC.And as we go through 2024, we would expect revenue to continue to ramp quarterly, and again, it will be mostly AI. Within the AI space, we've had very good customer engagement across the board from hyperscalers to OEMs, enterprise customers, and some of the new AI start-ups that are out there. From a workload standpoint, we would expect MI300 to be on both training and inference workloads. We're very pleased with the inference performance on MI300, especially for large language model inference, given some of our memory bandwidth and memory capacity.We think that's going to be a significant workload for us. But I think we would see a broad set of workloads as well as broad customer adoption.Toshiya Hari -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystThank you. And then as my follow-up, a question on the server CPU side. You talked about Genoa growing really nicely in the quarter. I think you talked about both units and volume being bigger than its predecessor.Is the growth that you're seeing or the growth that you saw in Q3 and the growth that you're guiding to for Q4, is this primarily a function of share growth or are you actually seeing a pickup in the overall market? And I ask the question because, obviously, year to date, there's been a significant shift away from traditional compute to accelerated computing, but are you actually starting to see signs of stabilization or even improvement on the traditional compute side? Thank you.Lisa Su -- President and Chief Executive OfficerSure. So, the way I would frame it is we're very pleased with our third-quarter performance as it relates to EPYC overall. I think the fourth-gen EPYC, so that's Genoa Plus Bergamo actually ramped very nicely. We got to a crossover in the third quarter, which is a little bit ahead of what we had previously forecasted.And when I look underneath that, I would say with a strong growth in both cloud \u2013 you know, cloud was strong so strong double digits. The adoption is pretty broad across first-party and third-party workloads and new instances. And then on the enterprise side, we've also seen some nice growth across our OEMs. And so, from the standpoint of, is it the market recovery or is it share gain? I think it's some of both.From a market standpoint, I would say it's still mixed. I think enterprise is still a little bit mixed depending on sort of which region from a macroeconomic standpoint. Cloud depends a bit on the customer set. But overall, I think we're pleased with the progress, and the leadership of EPYC has ended up allowing us to grow substantially in the third quarter and then into the fourth quarter.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.Aaron Rakers -- Wells Fargo Securities -- AnalystYeah, thank you for taking the question. Just to build off that last question, Jean, I think last quarter, you kind of endorsed the notion that your Data Center business would grow. I think it was in the high single-digit range. I think you started the year thinking like 10.So, I guess the question is, do you still see that kind of growth rate setup? And how has that $400 million evolved underneath that? Has that -- was it $300 million now going to $400 million? Just how has that changed over the course of the last quarter just to level set that Data Center expectation?Jean Hu -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and TreasurerYeah. So, I think for the second half, we said we expect Data Center business to grow approximately 50% versus first half. But right now, based on what we are seeing, we continue to see in that similar range of that 50%. So, we are very happy and pleased about the strong momentum of our Data Center business.On the GPU side, Lisa mentioned about $400 million, around $400 million. As we go through the quarter, we have a strong engagement with the customers. So, we do see the progress continues and we see customers placing orders. So, that's why when we go through the quarter, we start to --increasingly confident about the revenue profile in Q4 we are guiding.Lisa Su -- President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah. And Aaron, if I could add to that, if I can just add to that, I think what we've seen is the adoption rate of our AI solutions has given us confidence in not just the Q4 revenue number, but also sort of the progression as we go through 2024.Aaron Rakers -- Wells Fargo Securities -- AnalystYeah, that's helpful. And maybe just the follow-up. How would you characterize the supply side of the equation? As you look at that $2 billion number, do you feel confident that you've got adequate visibility in the supply side to hit those expectations? Any update on that side?Lisa Su -- President and Chief Executive OfficerSure, Aaron. So, we've been planning the supply chain for the last year and we're always planning for success. So, certainly, for the current forecast of greater than $2 billion, we have adequate supply. But we have also planned for a supply chain forecast that could be significantly higher than that, and we would continue to work with customers to build that out.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.Joe Moore -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystGreat. Thank you. Following up on the Data Center GPU, can you talk about the breadth of customers that you might see there? I assume it's fairly concentrated in Year 1, but you also did mention multiple hyperscalers. Can you just give us a sense for how concentrated that might be?Lisa Su -- President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah. Sure, Joe. So, we've been engaging broadly with the customer set. I think in the last earnings call, we said that our engagements had increased seven times.And so, there is a lot of interest in MI300. We will start, let's call it, more concentrated in cloud, sort of several large hyperscalers. But we're also very engaged across the enterprise and there's a lot of interest. Our partnerships with the OEMs are quite strong.And when we think about sort of the breadth of customers who are looking for AI solutions, we certainly see an opportunity, especially as we get beyond the initial ramp to broaden the customer set.Joe Moore -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystGreat. And now that you're getting a look at volume in that space, can you talk about, are the gross margins there going to be comparable to your other Data Center businesses?Jean Hu -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and TreasurerYeah. So, on the gross margin side, we do expect our GPU gross margin to be accretive to corporate average. Of course, right now, we are at a very, very early beginning of the ramp of the product. As you probably know, typically when you ramp new product, it takes some time to improve yield, testing time, manufacturing efficiency.So, typically, it takes a few quarters to ramp the gross margin to a normalized level. But we are quite confident that our team is executing really well.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please proceed with your question.Tim Arcuri -- UBS -- AnalystThank you. Lisa, I also wanted to ask about that $2 billion number for Data Center GPU next year. That's still a pretty small portion, obviously, of the total TAM. Where do you think that can go? Do you think when we look at this out a couple of years, do you think you can be 15%, 20% share for total Data Center GPU or do you have aspirations to be even larger than that?Lisa Su -- President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, Tim, I mean, I would say that first of all, this is an incredibly exciting market, right? I think we all see the growth in generative AI workloads. And the fact is we're just at the very early innings of people truly adopting it for enterprise business productivity applications. So, I think we are big believers in the strength of the market. We previously said we believe that the compound annual growth rate could be 50% over the next three or four years.And so, we think the market is huge and there will be multiple winners in this market. Certainly, from our standpoint, we want to be -- we're playing to win and we think MI300 is a great product, but we also have a strong road map beyond that for the next couple of generations. And we would like to be a significant player in this market. So, we'll see how things play out.But overall, I would say that I am encouraged with the progress that we're making on hardware and software and certainly with the customer set.Tim Arcuri -- UBS -- AnalystThanks a lot. And then Jean, I just wanted to ask on March. I know that there's a lot of moving parts. It sounds like Data Center is up, but PC is going to be down, normal seasonal.And Embedded and Gaming sound down as well. So, can you just help us shape sort of how to think about March? Is it down a smidge? Is it flat? Could it be up a little bit? And maybe then how to think about like first half, back half next year, if you even want to go there. Thanks.Jean Hu -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and TreasurerTim, we're guiding one quarter at a time. But just to help you with some of the color, as Lisa mentioned earlier, we said the Data Center GPU revenue will be flattish sequentially. That's the first thing, right? The mix will shift from El Capitan majority in Q4 to predominantly more for AI in Q1. So, because of the long lead time manufacturing cycle, we feel like it's going to be a similar level of revenue with the Data Center GPU.But in general, if you look at our business, we do have a seasonality. Typically, Q1, the Client business, server business, Gaming business seasonally is down. Of course, right now, we definitely have a little bit more seasonality, given Embedded and the Gaming dynamics we are seeing right now. Server and Client typically were down sequentially, seasonally too.But overall, I think we are really focused on just execution. We probably can provide more color when we get close to Q1 2024, and especially, Lisa, please add if we have any color we can provide on the whole year 2024.Lisa Su -- President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah. No, I think that covers it. When we look at the various pluses and minuses, I think we feel very good about the Data Center business. It continues to be a strong growth driver for us as we think about 2024 for both server as well as our MI300 clients as well, we think incrementally improves from a market standpoint as well as we believe we can gain share, given the strength of our product portfolio.And then we have the headwinds of Embedded in the inventory correction that we'll go through in the first half and the console cycle. So, I think those are the puts and takes.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.Vivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystThanks for taking my question. Lisa, on the MI300, many of your hyperscaler customers have internal ASIC solutions ready or in the process of getting them ready. So, if inference is the primary workload for MI300, do you think it is exposed to replacement by internal ASICs over time? Or do you think both MI300 and ASICs can coexist, right, along with the incumbent GPU solution?Lisa Su -- President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah. I think, Vivek, when we look at the set of AI workloads going forward, we actually think they're pretty diverse. I mean, you have sort of the large language model training and inference then you have what you might do in terms of fine-tuning off of a foundational model and then you have, let's call it, straight inferencing what you might do there. So, I think within that framework, we absolutely believe that MI300 has a strong place in the market, and that's what our customers are telling us and we're working very closely with them.So, yes, I think there will be other solutions, but I think for the -- particularly for the LLMs, I think GPUs are going to be the processing of choice and MI300's very, very capable.Vivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystGot it. And then a question, Lisa, on just this interplay between AI and traditional computing. It seems like especially when it relates to ASPs and units, seems like server CPU makers are kind of holding the line on price per core. But at the same time, the cloud players are extending the depreciation and replacement cycle of traditional server CPUs.So, I'm just curious to get your take. What do you think is the interplay between units and ASP, right? If you were to take a snapshot of what you have seen in '23 and how it kind of informs you as you look at '24, that is it possible that maybe unit growth in server is not that high but you are able to make up for it on the ASP side. So, just give us some color on, one, what is happening to traditional computing deployments? And secondly, is there a difference in kind of the unit and ASP interplay on the server CPU side?Lisa Su -- President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah. I think it's a good point, Vivek. So, I mean, if I take a look at 2023, I think it's been a mixed environment, right? There was a good amount of, let's call it, caution in the overall server market. There was a bit of inventory digestion at some of the cloud guys and then some optimization going on with enterprise, again, somewhat mixed.I think as we go forward, we've returned to growth in the server CPU market. Within that realm, because these -- like for example, fourth-gen EPYC, somewhere between 96 and 128 cores. I mean, you just get a lot of compute for that. So, I do think there is the framework -- that unit growth may be more modest, but ASP growth, given the core count and the compute capability will contribute to overall growth.So, from a traditional server CPU standpoint, I think we do see those trends. 2023 was a mixed environment and I think it improves as we go into 2024.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.Blayne Curtis -- Barclays -- AnalystThanks for taking my question. I want to ask on the Embedded side. I think last quarter, you kind of talked about the headwinds being mostly in the communications end market. You're guiding it down in December.I was curious if that weakness is spread. And then your competitor talked about kind of a reset getting back to pre-pandemic levels. Just kind of curious how you framed that reset. You said it'd be weak to the first half.Lisa Su -- President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, absolutely, Blayne. So, I think when we look at end markets, I think communications was weak in sort of last quarter and it certainly continues to be weak. We see 5G sort of capex just down overall. On the other market where we see a little bit of, let's call it, soft end market demand would be industrial and that's a little bit more geographic, so a little bit worse in Europe than in other geographies.The other end markets are actually relatively good. And what we just see is that inventory is high, just given where we were with lead times coming into the sort of through the pandemic and with the high demand that was out there. As the lead times have normalized, people are drawing down their inventories and they have an opportunity to do that, given the normalization. So, from an overall standpoint, we think demand is solid.And what we view is that we have a very strong portfolio in Embedded. We like sort of the combination of the, let's call it, the classic Xilinx portfolio together with the Embedded processing capabilities that we add. Customers have seen sort of that portfolio come together, and we've gotten some nice design win traction as a result of that. So, we have to get through sort of the next couple of quarters of inventory correction, and then we believe we'll return to growth in the second half of the year.Blayne Curtis -- Barclays -- AnalystThanks. And then I just wanted to ask on the PC market. I think you and Intel have seen -- you were under-shipping in the first half. Maybe you're kind of over shipping a little bit now, restocking.I'm just kind of curious of your perspective of what that normalized run rate is in terms of the size of the PC market and kind of any perspective if inventory levels are starting to move back up.Lisa Su -- President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah. I would say, again, Blayne, when we looked at sort of the third quarter and sort of the environment that we're in now, I think inventory levels are relatively normalized, and so the selling and consumption are fairly close. We were building up for a holiday season that is a strong season for us overall. When I think about the size of the market, I think from a consumption standpoint this year is probably somewhere like 250 million to 255 million units or so.We expect some growth going into 2024 as we think about sort of the AI PC cycle and some of the Windows refresh cycles that are out there. And I think the PC market returns to, let's call it, a typical seasonality, in which underneath that, we have a strong product portfolio. And we are very much focused on growing in places like high-end gaming, ultrathins, premium consumer as well as commercial. So, those are -- that's how sort of we see the PC market.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.Matt Ramsay -- TD Cowen -- AnalystThank you very much. Good afternoon. Lisa, I wanted to maybe ask the AI question a little bit differently, not just focused on your GPU portfolio but more broadly. I think one of the big surprises to a lot of us is how quickly the AI market changed from accelerator cards to selling full servers or full systems for your primary competitor.And they've done a lot of innovation not just on GPU but on CPU on their own custom interconnect, etc. So, what I'd like to hear a little bit of an update on is just how you think about your road map going forward across CPU, GPU, and networking and particularly the networking part as you look to continue to advance your AI portfolio. Thanks.Lisa Su -- President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah. Thanks, Matt. I think it's an important point. What we're seeing with these AI systems is they are truly complicated when you think about putting all of these components together.We are certainly working very closely with our partners in putting together sort of the full system, CPU, GPUs, as well as the networking capability. Our Pensando acquisition has actually been really helpful in this area. I think we have a world-class team of experts in this area, and we're also partnered with some of the networking ecosystem overall. So, going forward, I don't think we're going to sell full systems, let's call it, AMD-branded systems.We believe that there are others who are more set up for that. But I think from a definition standpoint and when we're doing development, we are certainly doing development with the notion of what that full system will look like. And we'll work very closely with our partners to ensure that that's well defined so that it's easy for customers to adopt our solutions.Matt Ramsay -- TD Cowen -- AnalystThank you for that perspective. As my second question, Jean, I wanted to dig into gross margin a little bit and just, I guess, compliment you and the team on being able to guide up for the fourth quarter. Sequentially, gross margin if we, I guess, rewound the clock back to the beginning of the year, and the Embedded segment would be down from the peak to where you're guiding the fourth quarter, maybe down by a third. I wouldn't have thought gross margin would have hung in as well and grown sequentially each quarter through the year.Obviously, Client margins got better. But maybe you could walk us through some of the puts and takes on gross margin, and inside of each segment, where you're making progress because I imagine some of that progress is pretty positive underneath. Thanks.Jean Hu -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and TreasurerYeah, Matt, thank you for the question. Yes, there are a few puts and takes, especially in a mixed demand environment. So, let me just comment on Q3 first. We are very pleased with our gross margin expansion sequentially, 140 basis points.As you mentioned, the Embedded segment, revenue actually declined double digits sequentially. There are two primary drivers. The first one is definitely Data Center grew 21% sequentially, which should provide a tailwind to our gross margin. Secondly, as we go through the inventory correction in PC market, we did encounter some headwinds in the Client segment gross margin.And in Q3, we saw very significant improvement with our client segment gross margin. I think going forward, the pace of Client segment improvement will moderate, but it will continue to drive incremental gross margin improvement in Client segment. So, that really is why we are able to drive sequential growth in Q3. And in Q4, I would say the major dynamics is with a very strong double-digit growth in Data Center business, we definitely have the tailwind, which more than offset the Embedded segment decline sequentially double digit again.I think going forward, it's really mix, primarily mix, is driving our gross margin, but we feel pretty good about second half next year when we can expand the Data Center significantly and especially Embedded segment start to recover, we should be able to drive more meaningful gross margin improvement in second half.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.Ross Seymore -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystHi. Lisa, I had a question on the MI300 side of things. When you go to market, obviously, there's been shortages this year of GPU accelerators, and so a second source is definitely needed. But beyond just providing that second source role, can you just walk us through some of the competitive advantages that the customer lists that you're going to talk about on the sixth is finding to be so attractive relative to your primary competitor?Lisa Su -- President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah. I think there's a couple of different things, Ross. I mean, if we start with, it's just a very capable product. The way it's designed from a triplet standpoint, we have a very strong compute as well as memory capacity and memory bandwidth.In inference, in particular, that's very helpful. And the way to think about it is on these larger language models, you can't fit the model on one GPU. You actually need multiple GPUs. And if you have more memory, you can actually use fewer GPUs to infer those models, and so it's very beneficial from a total cost of ownership standpoint.From a software standpoint, this has been perhaps the area where we've had to invest more and do more work. Our customers and partners are actually moving toward an area where they're more able to move across different hardware so really optimizing at the higher-level frameworks. And that's reducing the barrier of entry of sort of taking on a new solution. And we're also talking very much about, going forward, what the road map is.It's very similar to our EPYC evolution. When you think about sort of the -- our closest partners in the cloud environment, we work very closely to make each generation better. So, I think MI300 is an excellent product, and we'll keep evolving on that as we go through the next couple of generations.Ross Seymore -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystThen for my follow-up, I want to focus on the opex side of things. You guys have kept that pretty tight over the years. Jean, I just wondered what the puts and takes on that might be heading into 2024. I think you're exiting this year at about up kind of high single digits, maybe 10% year over year.Any sort of unique puts and takes, especially as you guys are driving for all that MI300 success as we think about opex generally in 2024?Jean Hu -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and TreasurerYeah, thanks for the question. Our team has done an absolutely great job in reallocating resources within our budget envelope to really invest in the most important areas in AI and the data center. We are actually in the planning process for 2024. I can comment on a very high level, given tremendous opportunities we have in AI and the Data Center, we definitely will increase both R&D investment and go-to-market investment to address those opportunities.I think the way to think about it is our objective is to drive top-line revenue growth much faster than opex growth, so our investment can drive long-term growth. And we also can leverage our operating model really actually expand earnings much faster than revenue. That's really how we think about running the company and driving the operating margin expansion.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.Harsh Kumar -- Piper Sandler -- AnalystYeah. Hi. Lisa, I had a strategic one for you and then somewhat of a tactical one. On the strategic side, as your key competitor is sort of getting their act together on the manufacturing technology and the nodes, would it not be feasible to think that their manufacturing cost could be significantly better, let's say, than that of yours? And so, if that's the case down the line one year or two years out, I'm curious what kind of value-add offerings would AMD have to provide to a customer to keep the market share that you have in the server space, data center space and then keep that growing as well?Lisa Su -- President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah. Harsh, maybe I should just take a step back and just talk about sort of the engagement that we have with our data center customers. When we think about sort of the EPYC portfolio and what we've been able to build over the last few generations and what we have going forward with Zen 5 and beyond, process technology is only one piece of the optimization. It's really about process technology, packaging.We're leading sort of the usage of chiplets and 2.5D and 3D integration and then when you go to architecture and design. So, it's really the holistic product. And from a pricing standpoint, actually, price is only one aspect of the conversation. Much of the conversation is on how much performance can you give me at what efficiency.So, from a -- from an overall efficiency standpoint, I think we've developed fantastic products. We are working closely with our customers to ensure that we continue to evolve our overall portfolio. So, I think from a value-added standpoint, it's providing the best TCO is what our customers are looking for, and that's where our road map is headed. Going forward, I think having the CPU, the GPU, the FPGAs, the DPUs, I think it gives us actually a nice portfolio to really optimize not just on a single component basis but on sort of all of the different workloads that you need in the data center.Harsh Kumar -- Piper Sandler -- AnalystVery helpful, Lisa. And then for my follow-up, a lot of folks that we talk to think that compute game is shifting completely from CPUs to GPUs. So, it was actually very encouraging to hear you talk about your core EPYC CPUs and the traction that you're seeing with the new generation of CPUs. So, I'm curious, if I was to ask you how you think the long-term growth prospects for the next, call it, two to three to four years are for your CPU business, not the GPU but the CPU business, I'm curious what the answer would be.Lisa Su -- President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah. So, look, I'm a big believer and you need all types of compute in the data center, especially when you look at the diverse set of workloads. There's a lot of excitement around AI, and we are very much clear that that is the No. 1 priority from a growth standpoint going forward.But the EPYC CPU business, we feel like we've consistently gained share throughout the last few years. And even with that, we're still underrepresented in large portions of the market, right? We're underrepresented in enterprise. We've seen some nice sort of sequential growth and nice prospects there, but there's a lot more we can do in enterprise. And we're still underrepresented in cloud third-party workloads, which, again, it's a -- you have to sell through the cloud manufacturers.So, I think overall, we feel good about our EPYC leadership and also our go-to-market efforts that will help us continue to grow that business in 2024 and beyond.Mitch Haws -- Head of Investor RelationsOperator, we have time for two more questions.OperatorAnd the next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question.Stacy Rasgon -- AllianceBernstein -- AnalystHi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I wanted to just dial in on the Q4 guidance. If you are going to grow Data Center 50% half over half and I assume Client is up sequentially, it implies Gaming and Embedded both likely down sequentially in the 20% range.I know you said double digits. But is that right? And if that is true, especially for Embedded, what does that mean going forward into next year? I know you said it's going to be weak in the first half. Does that mean -- I mean, is it stable at these levels or does it continue to decline through the first half until things stabilize? Just how do we think about that in the context of the guidance that you've given for Q4?Lisa Su -- President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah. Sure, Stacy. Let me take that and then Jean might add a few comments. So, without getting very specific, I would say I think your comments about Data Center and Client are correct.And then from an Embedded and Gaming standpoint, we would say Embedded, think about it down similar levels sort of in the teens compared to sort of Q3 was down in the teens and Q4 will be down in the teens. And then Gaming, from a console standpoint, we do expect that to be down a bit more than that. And then as we go into Q1, again without being -- there are lots of things that need to happen. We would expect that both gaming and embedded would be down into Q1 as well and sort of the other comments would be more around seasonality.Does that help?Stacy Rasgon -- AllianceBernstein -- AnalystThat does help. For my follow-up, again, I wanted to ask about gross margins. So, I know that they've been extending through the year, but for the full year, they're actually down. And I get the mix things and everything else.But as I look into next year, like how do I think about this because it sounds like Embedded is going to be pretty weak next year. Client is what it is. Data Center is growing but it does feel like even if the GPUs are accretive, they're not accretive yet, and it's going to take them a while to get to be accretive. Like how much do you think you can expand gross margins year over year like in '24 versus '23, given the trends that we have entering the year?Jean Hu -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and TreasurerYeah. Stacy, I'll say the first thing is if you look at 2023, it's a very unusual year for the industry, right, especially the PC market. It's one of the worst down cycles during the last three decades. So, during that kind of a down cycle, definitely, we had headwinds on gross margin side, on our Client business, which we have made significant progress in Q3 and Q4 in second half.Going into next year, the mix primarily is the driver of our gross margin. The way to think about it is Data Center is going to be the largest incremental revenue contributor next year. And then with both Gaming and Embedded facing continued sequential decline, I think it's all about the mix. We do expect next year will improve gross margin versus 2023, especially second half.So, that's how we think about it right now.OperatorAnd our final question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.Christopher Rolland -- Susquehanna International Group -- AnalystThanks for the question. There was an article suggesting that you guys could be interested in doing some ARM-based CPUs. I guess I'd love any thoughts that you have there on that architecture for PC. But also Apple has their M3 out now.It seems pretty robust. Qualcomm has an X Elite new chip. It was rumored NVIDIA might be doing that as well. Would love your expectations for this market.And what does that mean for the TAM for AMD moving forward?Lisa Su -- President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah. Sure, Chris. Thanks for the question. So, look, the way we think about ARM, ARM is a partner in many respects so we use ARM throughout parts of our portfolio.I think as it relates to PCs, x86 is still the majority of the volume in PCs. And if you think about sort of the ecosystem around x86 and Windows, I think it's been a very robust ecosystem. What I'm most excited about in PCs is actually the AI PC. I think the AI PC opportunity is an opportunity to redefine what PCs are in terms of productivity tool and really sort of operating on sort of user data.And so, I think we're at the beginning of a wave there. We're investing heavily in Ryzen AI and the opportunity to really broaden sort of the AI capabilities of PCs going forward. And I think that's where the conversation is going to be about. It's going to be less about what instructions that you're using and more about what experience are you delivering to customers.And from that standpoint, I think that we have a very exciting portfolio that I feel good about over the next couple of years.Christopher Rolland -- Susquehanna International Group -- AnalystThank you, Lisa. And one quick one on FPGA for the Data Center, in particular. That was a really cool fintech win. I understand that.Can you talk about where we stand in Data Center FPGA and that outlook, FPGA for AI? And could we even mix in an FPGA into the MI300 tile at some point or is there really, at this point, not an AI market for FPGA?Lisa Su -- President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah. I mean, Chris, the way I think about sort of FPGAs in the data center, it's another compute element. We do use FPGAs or there are FPGAs in a number of the systems. I would say from a revenue contribution standpoint, it's still relatively small sort of in the near term.We have some design wins going forward that we would see that content grow but that won't be so much in 2024, that will be beyond that. And part of our value proposition, I think, to our data center partners is, look, whatever compute element you need, whether it's CPUs or GPUs or FPGAs or DPUs or -- we have the ability to sort of bring those components together. And that is a strong point as we think about just how heterogeneous these data centers are going forward. So, thank you for that.OperatorAt this time, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. Now, I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mitch for any closing comments.Mitch Haws -- Head of Investor RelationsGreat, John. That concludes today's call.

            "title": "AMD makes bold prediction for its AI chips \u2014 but it's actually not so far-fetched",
            "description": "AMD's bold AI outlook may look like a high hurdle, but it's quite feasible that CEO Lisa Su can deliver on her promise.Advanced Micro Devices Inc. gave Wall Street a bold projection for revenue from its first AI chips for next year, and while the outlook may look like a high hurdle, it\u2019s quite feasible that Chief Executive Lisa Su can deliver on her promise.Su told analysts on AMD\u2019s AMD, +1.58% earnings call Tuesday that the company could see data-center revenue from its graphics processing units (GPUs) of about $400 million in the fourth quarter, while that total could exceed $2 billion in 2024 as revenue continues to ramp. \u201cThis growth would make MI300 the fastest product to ramp to a billion dollars in sales in AMD history,\u201d Su said. Su\u2019s forecast was bolder than what some on Wall Street had been predicting. Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers said in a note late Tuesday that Su\u2019s forecast was \u201csolidly ahead\u201d of his recently raised $1.7 billion estimate for AMD\u2019s data-center GPU revenue.The upbeat AI talk helped offset a less rosy overall outlook for the fourth quarter, driven by drags from AMD\u2019s gaming and embedded-chip businesses. That forecast initially sent AMD shares down about 5% after hours following the release of results, but the stock finished the extended session off less than 1% as the AI commentary appeared to soothe investors. Su made a compelling case that AMD will be able to hit its optimistic forecast. She talked about the company\u2019s engagements with customers for its new chip family called the MI300, the strong demand for chips that are designed for artificial intelligence and the \u201csignificant\u201d progress AMD has seen so far with the MI300.\u201cI think we\u2019re very happy with how the technical milestones look, and then also we\u2019ve made significant progress from a customer side,\u201d she said, calling out strong engagement with customers ranging from hyperscalers to enterprise customers to new AI startups. The company didn\u2019t name any potential customers yet.AI chips could help fuel growth in AMD\u2019s data-center segment, which came in flat at $1.6 billion during the third quarter. AMD has made huge inroads with corporate customers since its return to the server market years ago under Su, and those enterprise customers should be much more willing to try new chips from AMD now.Also read: Take a bow Lisa Su: AMD\u2019s data center business is a true rival to Intel.Su said AMD\u2019s new graphics-processor chips designed to accelerate AI will be targeted at workloads for both inference and training, but she emphasized their performance in inference workloads.The training area of AI is currently dominated by Nvidia Corp. NVDA, +0.38%, which has already seen huge increases in revenue from companies looking to run AI in data centers. But Nvidia\u2019s supply has been constrained, and the CEO of d-Matrix, a chip startup, told MarketWatch recently that customers are looking around for alternatives. In recent days, investors have gotten nervous that the latest U.S. ban on certain advanced chips to China could affect billions of dollars in future revenue for Nvidia, based on a Wall Street Journal report.The ban on China sales on could potentially affect AMD as well, and it\u2019s not the only risk for the company. Bernstein Research analyst Stacy Rasgon pointed out some other risks to AMD\u2019s AI ambitions in a note prior to AMD\u2019s earnings on Tuesday. \u201cWhile we do suspect incremental revenues will begin sooner (and expect the company to talk up new customer wins) we do not expect real volume until the [second half], (which could somewhat limit the growth runway for it next year and also leaves them open to Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell launch around the same time),\u201d Rasgon said earlier this week.So far, though, Su has not been one to make projections lightly, and it appears that she has high confidence in AMD\u2019s products and the company\u2019s relationships with its customers. AMD is counting on being a big part of the growing AI boom, and management\u2019s willingness to put a number on the opportunity should make investors feel better about the company\u2019s ability to capitalize on the new market. Cisco slashed its revenue forecast for the fiscal year, and its shares were plunging in Wednesday's extended session.Therese Poletti writes the \"Tech Tales\" column for MarketWatch.

            "title": "AMD's revenue outlook comes in light, but company gives a rosy AI forecast",
            "description": "The company came up short with its revenue forecast but talked up its opportunities in artificial intelligenceAdvanced Micro Devices Inc. shares largely erased losses in Tuesday\u2019s extended session after the company came up short with its revenue forecast but talked up its opportunities in artificial intelligence. AMD shares AMD, +1.58%, which fell about 5% shortly after the release of the company\u2019s third-quarter earnings, ended the after-hours session down just 0.6%.For the fourth quarter, AMD modeled $5.8 billion to $6.4 billion in revenue, while analysts were looking for $6.4 billion. The company also said it expected an adjusted gross margin of about 51.5%, which compares with 51% in the third quarter.Opinion: Sluggish EV and auto sales could continue next year, based on what these chip makers just saidBut Wall Street was keen to hear updates on the company\u2019s AI progress heading into the report, and Chief Executive Lisa Su delivered on the earnings call. \u201cBased on the rapid progress we are making with our AI roadmap execution and purchase commitments from cloud customers,\u201d she said that AMD anticipates $400 million in revenue from data-center graphics processing units during the fourth quarter. That total could top $2 billion in 2024.\u201cThe way to think about it is, in the fourth quarter, we said revenue would be approximately $400 million, and that\u2019s mostly HPC [high-performance computing],\u201d though the company would also see its AI ramp start. \u201cAnd then as we go into the first quarter, we actually expect revenue to be approximately similar in that $400 million range, and that will be mostly AI, so with a very small piece being HPC,\u201d she continued. Revenue could continue ramping on a quarterly basis moving through 2024, she noted. \u201cThere is a lot of interest in MI300,\u201d Su said, referring to the company\u2019s accelerator product. \u201cWe will start, let\u2019s call it, more concentrated in cloud, [with] sort of several large hyperscalers, but we\u2019re also very engaged across the enterprise and there\u2019s a lot of interest.\u201dThe company posted third-quarter net income of $299 million, or 18 cents a share, compared with $66 million, or 4 cents a share, in the year-before quarter. On an adjusted basis, AMD earned 70 cents a share, up from 67 cents a share a year before, while analysts tracked by FactSet were expecting 68 cents a share. Revenue increased to $5.80 billion from $5.57 billion a year before, while the FactSet consensus was for $5.70 billion. Don\u2019t miss: Wolfspeed\u2019s stock rallies as company notches smaller loss than expectedData-center revenue came in at $1.6 billion, flat with the year-earlier sum and in line with the FactSet consensus, as AMD saw growth from its 4th Gen Epyc central processing units but declines in adaptive system-on-chip (SoC) data-center products. Revenue for that segment was up 21% sequentially, however. \u201cOur data-center business is on a significant growth trajectory based on the strength of our Epyc CPU portfolio and the ramp of Instinct MI300 accelerator shipments to support multiple deployments with hyperscale, enterprise and AI customers,\u201d Su said in a release.AMD posted $1.5 million in client-segment revenue, up 42% from a year before amid strength in Ryzen mobile processors. The FactSet consensus was for $1.2 billion.Gaming revenue fell 8% to $1.5 billion and matched the FactSet consensus.The company also saw $1.2 billion in embedded sales, down 5% from a year before and slightly below the FactSet consensus of $1.3 billion.

AMD reported Tuesday after the market close third-quarter earnings and revenue that came in ahead of expectations. Strong PC and server processor sales led to the outperformance. AMD CEO hinted at a strong ramp of Instinct MI300 accelerator shipments.The guidance for the fourth quarter was roughly in line with estimates, sending the stock lower in after-hours trading.AMD reported third-quarter non-GAAP earnings per shar, or EPS, of 70 cents per, up 4 % from the year-ago earnings per share of 67 cents. The bottom-line climbed 21% from second-quarter\u2019s $0.58 per share.Analysts, on average, had modeled EPS, of 64 cents for the quarter.

In early August, AMD guided third-quarter revenue to be approximately $5.7 billion, plus or minus $300 million. The company penciled in non-GAAP gross margin at about 51% compared to the previous quarter\u2019s 50% and year-ago\u2019s 54%. KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh had modeling in line with slightly higher results, premised on improving PC demand and troughing server demand, along with normalizing Milan server processor chip inventory at Cloud Service providers. Raymond James\u2019 Srini Pajjuri called for a slight third-quarter upside based on his view that PC tracked slightly better, and the Data Center tracked in line.Rival Intel Corp. INTC last week reported EPS and revenue of 41 cents and $14.16 billion, respectively, ahead of the consensus estimates of 22 cents and $13.57 billion, respectively.AMD\u2019s non-GAAP gross margin came in at 51%, in line with the guidance. This compares favorably to the previous quarter\u2019s 50%.\u201cWe delivered strong revenue and earnings growth driven by demand for our Ryzen 7000 series PC processors and record server processor sales,\" said Su. \"Our data center business is on a significant growth trajectory based on the strength of our EPYC CPU portfolio and the ramp of Instinct MI300 accelerator shipments to support multiple deployments with hyperscale, enterprise and AI customers,\u201d she added.See Also: Best Semiconductor StocksPC processor sales rose strongly, with the Client segment revenue surging a better-than-expected 42% year-over-year and surged up 46% sequentially to $1.5 billion. Ahead of the results, RayJay\u2019s Pajjuri said, \u201cWe believe that the worst is now behind and expect AMD to benefit from inventory normalization,\u201d he added.The Data Center segment came in at $1.6 billion, flat year-over-year, as the company's fourth-generation EPYC server processor sales growth was offset by a decline in sales of SoC data center products. Sequentially, revenue rose 21%On the other hand, Gaming segment\u2019s revenue fell 8% year-over-year and was down 5% sequentially to $1.5 billion due to a decline in semicustom revenue. Embedded segment revenue, derived primarily from Xilinx unit, came in at $1.2 billion, down 5% year-over-year and 15% sequentially due to revenue decline from the communications market.AMD guided to fourth-quarter revenue of $6.1 billion plus or minus $300 million. The current consensus estimates call for revenue of $6.01 billion. At the mid-point, this represents year-over-year growth of approximately 9% and sequential growth of approximately 5%, the company said.Analysts are guarded. KeyBanc\u2019s Vinh said he sees moderate risk to the fourth-quarter guidance, given his view that there could be some volume pushout of MI300A at HP/El Capitan. But he expects the ramp-up to happen in the fourth quarter. The analyst also noted signs of a more moderate ramp-up of Genoa, as some customers have pushed out the timing of their ramps.RayJay models modest revenue from MI300X GPU in the fourth quarter and a gradual ramp through 2024.The company sees fourth-quarter non-GAAP gross margin at 51.1%.CFO Jean Hu said, \u201cIn the fourth quarter, we expect to see strong growth in Data Center and continued momentum in Client, partially offset by lower sales in the Gaming segment and additional softening of demand in the embedded markets.\"AMD, which trails the frontrunners in the AI race, announced its in-house AI accelerated processing units, MI300X and the more advanced MI300A, earlier this year. The company is expected to begin shipments of these AI accelerators this year, paving the way for reaping the AI windfall in the upcoming year. The stock has gained about 52% year-to-date, outperforming the S&P 500\u2019s and Nasdaq-100\u2032s gains of 9.2% and 29.6%, respectively. The iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX has risen 28.1% in the same timeframe.The average rating for the stock is a Strong Buy, and the average consensus price target is $136.18, according to data from TipRanks.

Learn MoreShares of Lattice Semiconductor (LSCC -3.12%) fell as much as 20.1% on Tuesday morning. The maker of field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) reported robust earnings, but modest guidance for the next quarter left investors disappointed. The stock recovered somewhat over time but was still down by 16.6% as of 2:10 p.m. ET.Your average analyst had expected earnings of roughly $0.52 per share on sales in the neighborhood of $192.1 million. Lattice edged out these expectations across the board. Earnings rose 10% year over year to $0.53 per share while revenue increased 11% to $192.2 million.So far, so good. But the story changed when investors considered management's fourth-quarter guidance. Top-line sales for that period were pointed toward approximately $176 million, which would be up from $142 million in the year-ago report but well below the analyst consensus at $196 million.On the earnings call, Lattice's management highlighted soft sales in certain end markets. Most of the upcoming shortfall was attributed to the industrial and automotive sectors, where many infrastructure upgrades are on hold amid the ongoing inflation crisis.At the same time, management said that the company has a plethora of new product designs and several important contract wins in the third quarter. Therefore, Lattice might be up for some lumpy results in the short term, but things should be fine in the long run.CEO Jim Anderson said, \"We believe that industrial automation, robotics, automotive electronics, that these applications are in multiyear secular-growth trends that will last for many years over the long term, and that Lattice and Lattice Devices are really well positioned to take advantage of those secular growth trends.\"Management comments are never 100% reliable indicators of what's next, but Anderson's analysis certainly makes sense. Lattice serves a wide range of potentially powerful growth markets, and I would be shocked to see all of them stuck in quicksand much longer. And don't forget that Lattice is both profitable and debt-free.This is not my favorite semiconductor stock, especially since mighty Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 1.74%) is leaning into the FPGA market after the $49 billion Xilinx buyout, but today's price cut looks overly zealous. If you were looking for an opportunity to buy Lattice Semiconductor stock on a dip, this would be a good time to take action.Anders Bylund has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Learn MoreIntel's (INTC 5.98%) stock jumped 9% on Oct. 27 after it posted its third-quarter earnings report. The chipmaker's revenue fell 8% year over year to $14.2 billion but exceeded analysts' expectations by $560 million. Its adjusted earnings grew 11% to $0.41 per share and also cleared the consensus forecast by $0.19 per share.Intel's revenue is still declining year over year, but its stock has already risen about 34% in 2023 in anticipation of the PC market's cyclical turnaround. Does this chip giant still have room to run, or it too late to hop aboard the bullish bandwagon?Image source: Getty Images.Intel generated 56% of its revenue from its client computing group (CCG) in Q3. That segment mainly sells its x86 CPUs for PCs. Its revenue has declined year over year for nine consecutive quarters as the market's demand for new PCs -- which surged throughout the pandemic -- cooled off in a post-pandemic world.Fierce competition from AMD (AMD 1.74%), which pulled ahead of Intel in the \"process race\" to create smaller and denser chips by outsourcing its manufacturing to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM -0.21%), worsened that slowdown. Intel remains committed to manufacturing its own chips, but catching up to TSMC has been a costly endeavor. Another 27% of Intel's revenue came from its data center and artificial intelligence (DCAI) group, which produces Xeon CPUs and programmable chips for data centers. That segment's revenue also slumped year over year for five consecutive quarters as the macroeconomic headwinds drove many data center operators to rein in their spending.The network and edge (NEX) group, which sells networking products and edge computing chips, accounted for 11% of Intel's revenue and also struggled with macro headwinds over the past year. The remaining 6% of top-line sales came from the company's controlling stake in the automotive chipmaker Mobileye (MBLY -1.12%), which it partly spun off in an IPO last October, and its foundries. All three of Intel's core businesses shrank year over year in Q3. But on a sequential basis, its total revenue actually rose 10%, which was its second consecutive quarter of sequential growth.MetricQ3 2022Q4 2022Q1 2023Q2 2023Q3 2023CCG revenue growth (YOY)(17%)(23%)(38%)(12%)(3%)DCAI revenue growth (YOY)(27%)(15%)(39%)(15%)(10%)NEX revenue growth (YOY)14%11%(30%)(38%)(32%)Total revenue growth (YOY)(15%)(28%)(36%)(15%)(8%)Data source: Intel. YOY = year over year.On a sequential basis, Intel's CCG revenue jumped 16%, its DCAI sales dipped 5%, and its NEX revenue rose 7%. Its foundry services division -- which it aggressively expanded to keep pace with TSMC in the process race -- grew its revenue 34% sequentially and 299% year over year, but still only accounted for 2% of the tech titan's top line.Nevertheless, the simultaneous growth of Intel's CCG and foundry segments strongly implies the PC market is finally bottoming out. During the conference call, CFO David Zinsner said the company was \"encouraged by the return of historical purchasing cycles,\" with \"healthy inventory levels and growing demand.\" For the fourth quarter, Intel expects its revenue to rise 3%-10% sequentially -- and finally increase 4%-11% year over year -- to $14.6 billion-$15.6 billion.Intel's gross and operating margins declined over the past year as its revenue growth cooled off and it ramped up the expansion of its first-party foundries. However, its gross margin still expanded sequentially over the past two quarters as its average selling prices improved, and its operating margins strengthened thanks to tighter cost-cutting strategies.MetricQ3 2022Q4 2022Q1 2023Q2 2023Q3 2023Adjusted gross margin45.9%43.8%38.4%39.8%45.8%Adjusted operating margin10.8%4.3%(2.5%)3.5%13.6%Data source: Intel.For the fourth quarter, Intel expects its adjusted gross margin to expand sequentially and year over year to 46.5% as its adjusted EPS more than quadruples.During the conference call, Zinsner reiterated Intel's long-term goal of achieving 60% gross and 40% operating margins. The confident outlook implies it won't be rendered obsolete by TSMC or AMD anytime soon.Analysts expect Intel's revenue and adjusted earnings to decline 22% and 68%, respectively, this year. But for 2024, they forecast its sales and earnings to grow 12% and 176%, respectively, as the PC market finally warms up again.Based on those expectations, Intel trades at 22 times next year's earnings. By comparison, AMD trades at 24 times forward earnings, while TSMC has a lower forward multiple of 15. Intel still looks reasonably valued relative to its peers, but its low forward dividend yield of 1.4% probably won't limit its downside potential.In short, I don't think it's too late to bet on Intel's long-term recovery. However, it will need to grow its revenue at a steady rate, expand its margins, and prove it can keep pace with TSMC in the process race in order to drive its stock even higher.Leo Sun has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

            "title": "Charlie Munger says there\u2019s not much \u2018low-hanging fruit left\u2019 as he discusses Apple, Costco vs. Walmart, and EVs",
            "description": "Our call of the day comes from a podcast interview with the legendary Charlie Munger, who discusses a range of investing topics.How tough is it to make a dime in markets these days?\u201dInvestment legend Charlie Munger will tell you. Our call of the day comes from the billionaire vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway BRK.A, +0.51% BRK.B, +0.62%, who offered investing insights via a podcast from Acquired over dinner at his Los Angeles home. The interview published Oct. 29. Warren Buffett\u2019s right hand man acknowledged the tough hunt for good investments, as he discussed bets on Costco, Apple, Japanese trading companies and more. \u201cThere was a lot of low hanging fruit in the early days to our operation, you don\u2019t have any low hanging fruit that\u2019s easy right now,\u201d he said.He repeats that view later on, saying the \u201clow hanging fruit for the idiot is not gone, but it\u2019s very small,\u201d when asked how Berkshire selected its biggest holding, Apple AAPL, +0.66%, back in 2016.\u201cEverybody needs some significant participation in the 12 companies that do better than everybody else and you need two or three of them at least, and if you have that mindset, Apple is a logical candidate to be on the list,\u201d he said. And how did they pick the iPhone maker out of the roster of Big Tech companies? \u201cWe couldn\u2019t find anything else. It got cheap \u2014 10 times earnings.\u201d Munger was asked why he thought all the Big Tech dominants \u2014 Apple, Microsoft MSFT, +1.56%, Tesla TSLA, -4.32%, Alphabet GOOG, +1.59% etc. \u2014 have become so concentrated in markets, pensions and 401k plans. \u201cIt was natural\u2026that\u2019s what human nature and competition causes\u2026eventually with this craziness in venture capital, when they\u2019ve all gone stupid, that\u2019s a natural outcome.\u201d And when asked to divulge advice on finding those good bets, he said: \u201cWhen you know you have an edge, you should bet heavily.\u201d Munger weighed in on Costco COST, -3.18%, which Berkshire sold off in 2020, though the billionaire still owns it and has said he\u2019d never sell any. \u201cWell they really did sell cheaper than anybody else in America and they did it in big efficient stores\u2026the parking spaces were 10 feet wide instead of 8 feet or whatever they normally are\u2026they kept out of their stores all these people who didn\u2019t do big volumes. They gave special benefits to the people who did come to the stores in the way of reward points. It all worked,\u201d he says.He said Walmart WMT, -8.29% has made a big error over the years versus Costco, chiefly being \u201ctoo wedded to the ideas they already had\u201d and unable to accept new ideas. Walmart got stuck into a formula of going into small towns where real estate was not worth much, and keeping their occupancy costs down.\u201cSo it offended them to go against the rich suburbs and have to pay up for good locations, and Costco just specialized in the good locations where the rich people live. and Walmart just let them do it year after year and it was a terrible mistake,\u201d he said. Munger added that he likes Costco for the next 10 years, and buying now at current prices may work, but \u201cit\u2019s getting hard.\u201dHe was also asked whether the auto industry and electric vehicles were more investible due to disruption. \u201cMaybe for one or two electric cars [makers] that are really good at it, but certainly nobody else. It\u2019s too tough,\u201d he said.Munger praised China EV maker, BYD 002594, -0.14%, which Berkshire owns as a \u201ca miracle, but that guy works 70 hours a week and has a very high IQ. He can do things you can\u2019t do, he can look at somebody else\u2019s auto part and he can figure out how to make the\u2026thing. You can\u2019t do that.\u201d While not naming names, one assumes he\u2019s talking about BYD\u2019s rags-to-riches chairman Wang Chuanfu. Munger also discussed his aversion to so-called \u201cstyle companies,\u201d like Nike NKE, -0.50%, though he offered praise for luxury makers like Herm\u00e8s RMS, -0.41%, adding that \u201cI suppose if you offered me Herm\u00e8s at a cheap enough price I\u2019d buy it.\u201d What makes those kinds of companies enduring is \u201cthey\u2019ve got a brand people trust so much,\u201d he said. He also touched on Berkshire\u2019s much-discussed investments in five Japanese trading companies, Mitsubishi 8058, -0.93%, Mitsui 8031, -0.84%, Itochu, 8001, -0.55%, Marubeni 8002, -1.19% and Sumitomo 8053, -0.92%. Those stakes were boosted by Berkshire this summer. Munger called the investment a \u201cno-brainer. Something like that, if you\u2019re as smart as Warren Buffett, maybe two, three times a century you get an idea like that. The interest rates in Japan were half a percent a year for 10 years and these trading companies were really entrenched old companies\u2026so you could borrow for 10 years ahead all the money and you could buy the stock and the stock made 5% dividends so there is a huge flow of cash with no investment, no thought, no anything. How often do you do that?\u201d But he added that it was tough to build stakes in those, and Berkshire had to be \u201cvery patient and pick away little pieces at a time. It took forever to get 10 billion dollars in investment but it was like just like God opening a chest and pouring money into it. It was awfully easy money.\u201dMunger also weighed on his sour taste for venture capital, saying it\u2019s akin to \u201cgambling\u201d these days, as some of the deals \u201cget so hot and you have to decide so quickly.\u201d Also he said a lot of VCs these days make money by \u201cscrewing\u201d their investors. He briefly discussed China, where he says the economy has \u201cbetter prospects over the next 20 years than almost any other big economy. Number one, the leading companies in China are stronger and better than practically any other\u201d and cheaper, he added.Among Asian companies, though, TSMC 2330, +0.34% is not one he\u2019d hold because it doesn\u2019t really have a \u201cbrand of its own\u201d like Apple, said the storied investor.
